Everyone in my house is going vegetarian so you know on stage night it can be a lonely night so I've had to make some really smart adjustments and this dish has been inspired by my time in California. This is an amazing cauliflower steak that will be on your table in literally 10 minutes. Quicker than you can say the word vegan, right? Oscar. Pan down Beautiful cauliflower. We're going to take the steak, the center cut and the rest will use for cauliflower and cheese soup, puree, whatever you want to do or even a cauliflower couscous. But that middle steak is the money shot. Beautiful onions, caraway seeds, parsley, shallots, garlic, dill mint, sugar, beautiful mustard. and like I heard the Provence because we're gonna make a sort of fresh salsa verde. But first things first, let's get that steak on. Let's have 10 minutes on the clock please Now Hot Pan Gas up. Cauliflower steak doesn't sound original, but this is going to transform the way you eat cauliflower. Put a little mark there, a little mark that side and what I'm trying to do is make sure I get that beautiful steak in the center. Save that for later. Keep that on there and look. I want to come down about an inch thick and go all the way through and look that is what I want. A beautiful steak. Now gently place that down these little bits of cauliflower. trust me. Great for coffee and cheese and bacon, etc. Soups purees. Now let's get some all in the pan. Okay, get the gas up Okay, I want to give some really nice flavor to this cauliflower. Gently lift it up as it starts to smoke in, she goes lay away from you. Keep that down there. Gotta get some color on that. No color, no flavor even when I'm talking about cauliflower salt, cracked pepper. And then let's get some aromats in there. Some garlic doesn't need to be peeled, just literally crushed and in. Now gently get color on that next pan. It's gonna be a dry pan. I'm gonna toast our spices. We've got some caraway seeds going in. okay, some almonds going in and this is sort of a nice sort of fragrant toast. A nice seasoning and gives it a really nice sort of beautiful flavor. I'm going to put a little pinch of caraway in the bottom of the pan. I'm getting some color on that now. give it a little shake. Gently, lift that up. you just start to see the color. How do we get more color on there little knobs of butter? Okay, that's like a really nice flavor. I've got the garlic sort of working. its magic from there. look that smells incredible now. literally. Lemon in lemon juice helps to keep it nice and white, but also just roasting that in there. the sort of lemon starts to puree and this cauliflower starts to become a little bit more fragrant. I'm toasting my seeds here, a flavor that smells incredible now. Also got the color on the cauliflower steak. Literally. lift that up, turn that over, turn down the gas, add a touch of water or stock in, Bring that back up to the boil instantly as it starts boiling. Put that lid on, and then turn that gas down. Time please. Seven minutes. Beautiful. Now from there, I'm going to take out my beautiful almonds and Chloe. See, Just let them toast and sit. That's beautiful. It smells incredible. Now for the salsa verde. Okay, it's a very sort of acidic, delicious garnish and it's almost better than the garnish because it's quite substantial. I'm going to chop up the shallots not too fine. Okay, beautifully done, all the way down to the root and then look into the bowl. Now, from there, take your mint and take your dill and take your parsley and scrunch it up. almost like a big fat cigar. Now just chop the herbs. once. I say once because I want the freshness left in the herb. Sometimes when you over chop herbs, the board turns green. I want the green and the flavor in the salsa verde. look. My board's clean look really important because when you slice something, it starts to bleed and I want it bleeding. sort of almost flavor coming out of those herbs into the salsa verde. salt pepper and this is where it starts to go up a different level. A nice tablespoon of mustard, A nice tablespoon of brown sugar, two tablespoons of red wine vinegar in, and then the olive oil. Now the olive oil. Don't go crazy. Olive oil. Mix that up and sort of keep it quite dense and thick. You never really have a salsa verde that is literally runny. It's quite a nice, beautiful, chunky, thick, rich liquid. And then of course your beautiful dried herbs. Now I know they're fresh and dried herbs in there, but as the dry herbs start to sort of rehydrate inside, it opens up this amazing amount of flavor. The sugar gives it the sweetness, the vinegar gives it the tartness, and the olive oil gives that celta verde a really nice rich texture. from there that's so good. Take some of my almonds and my seeds and just crunch them up into there, save some on top and beautifully beautifully mix them in. Now I need a bit of a sheen, This can be served as a wonderful sort of side dish or an actual main course time, please. Four minutes and look, that's what I want. I want that really nice picant Salsa verde. [Music] Beautiful. Now check the cauliflower. Now here's where the magic is. The gas is down. The idea now is coating that steak. I've got the smell of the garlic, the lemon and the bay leaves in there. Take off that lid. Oh oh that smell beautiful. I touch more butter and this is where it starts to sort of work. Its magic. I'm going to whack up the gas. Okay, and this is like almost what we call a fondant. and the word fondon comes from a sheen and we're sort of now glazing, tilting the pan and glazing this beautiful cauliflower steak. [Music] And the flavor is incredible. Turn that gas up, check the seasoning, oh lovely. Touch more salt, some beautiful fresh black pepper, and then look. I'll take my lemon out and just squeeze a beautiful juice over that cauliflower. The smell is incredible. Get your small knife and it should literally just be going through the steak and look, it's just going through and that tells you it's beautifully cooked from there. One more final glaze. Now I'm reducing that down, the butter, the olive oil, the seasoning, the bay leaves, the garlic, push all them back off with the gas and this steak comes home to rest. Look at that that sits on the middle of your plate. This juice in here is incredible. Glaze the steak with your juice and then get this beautiful salsa verde. I want it fresh so I want to sort of macerate that over and let it seep through. Now, I don't sit down and easily eat this for sort of three or four minutes because I want that salsa verde to sort of penetrate and go through from top to the bottom. that incredible beautiful steak, Fresh extra virgin olive oil, and then my seeds. My beautiful toasted almonds. Now that is so good. A beautiful cauliflower steak in under 10 minutes. Honestly, tonight it makes me want to turn vegetarian to all of you.

We're going to take the steak, the center cut and the rest will use for cauliflower and cheese soup, puree, whatever you want to do. Salsa verde can be served as a wonderful side dish or an actual main course time, please. The idea now is coating that steak with the smell of the garlic, the lemon and the bay leaves in there. Take some of my almonds and my seeds and just crunch them up into there, save some on top and beautifully beautifully mix them in.",

Come on, I have all the perfect recipes and tips and tricks for you all. Welcome to Ramsey in 10. [music] Right Babette or Flank, whatever you like to call it. This steak, Trust me. It's so versatile and really delicious, especially for those on the go like me. It's so quick to cook with and I'm going to show you how to make a blackened steak with a delicious kimchi fried rice adding some beautiful Korean flair to your standard steak, right? Come on, Oscar, Pan down, Let me show you the ingredients. So this is it. This is a beautiful flank steak and it's a bit of a chef's cut, but more importantly, the flavor is incredible. Okay, so it looks slightly ugly. It's not your fillet, not your rib eye, but it is so delicious. Cheap and cheerful and freaking delicious. Leftover rice from the weekend? Okay, a little bit of chili saturating the oil, some beautiful radish to finish to give that nice acidity, Some kimchi buffered eggs, a little bit of, um, spring onions or scallions across the pond, and then these. Um, in order to cook a steak properly, you need a decent pan. So these are the Rolls-royce of pans, right? First off, let's get 10 minutes on the clock, right? First things first: Always take this steak out of the fridge. Okay, don't cook the steak ice cold. Okay, so take out the fish ten minutes before you start cooking it. That makes it relax. it. starts to render the fat. and more importantly, it cooks so much quicker at room temperature. Bit of salt, bit of pepper. Okay, so I like that to sort of sit there okay, and sort of almost marinate now. pans on. get them really nice and hot. Okay, The actual kimchi fried rice. I want to get some texture on there as well. And then we're going to top that off with a fried egg. So cook your fried egg nice and slowly. I like to start off and then let it sit and rest. But let's get some power into that steak. A couple of tablespoons of soy sauce? Okay, a couple of tablespoons of hoisin sauce? Okay. Oops. Mmm. Delicious. A couple teaspoons of hoisin sauce. Literally equal measures from there. Mix that up okay, and then just lightly brush that steak. Okay, brush. Now you want to cover that now. As you can see, I've got all that sort of marinade there. again, over, roll that in, and again generously. okay. There's a really nice fat marbling running through this steak. The secret behind this cut of steak? You've got to let it rest. You never slice this piping hot. Okay, the minute you slice it piping hot, you're gonna burst the steak and you're gonna lose all that amazing flavor. Now I've already got the marinade in there. Okay, so we don't need to all the pan. I've got the marinade on my plate. Now That I've seasoned it just a touch more each side. If you want to impart some really good flavor, get that done the night before. Wait to see the difference in flavor is extraordinary In and lay away from me in the pan. Okay, six o'clock right through to 12 o'clock Right on top. Now time please. Two minutes gone. Okay. touch of olive oil in there? Give that a nice little shake. Now for the rice. Get that pan. super hot. Okay, if your pans are getting too hot too quickly, just slide it, turn it down, slide it off the heat. It's a quick way of cooling down a pan. Now, from there, we've got a really nice color. You want to caramelize that okay kimchi hot pan tablespoon of oil and then drain off some of that vinegar. Okay, and just get it in between the cloth and pat it nice and dry. That's going to get that kimchi nice and crispy into the pan. Beautiful, really beautiful touch of salt. Now look at my steak coloring beautifully up and over again. Almost got that sort of nice light barbecue flavor Oscar, Panda and Panda and some pan down. Look, look at that flavor in there, caramelizing fats rendering down and got that nice intense heat, right? Kimchi. Now we've got some color on there. Out the kimchi, okay, touch more olive oil and then open up your rice. When I say open up, I mean sort of just sort of sprinkle it in there and as you're running out through your fingers, like that, you're opening up those little rice grains and that way it's going to get really nice and crispy. Do not touch it. Okay, Just leave it there and get it nice and crispy. It's like a sort of snack Crackle and pop time please. Six minutes, Four minutes gone. Thank you, right? Look at that steak. Best thing to do now. Turn off the gas. Okay, let that cool down and look. Get your marinade and just brush that over there again. That's right. I'm gonna leave the steak cooling down in the pan. Okay, turn that over and literally brush. Beautiful. Let that sit there and almost cool down in this marinade. So beautiful. Now the rice. Let me show you a little trick. Get the ladle and just bang it down. You get that rice. Really nice and crispy. Okay. push, push, push, push down. You'll see why in a minute. From there. a little touch of salt, a little touch of pepper, and just a hint of chili flake. Okay, now for my egg. Okay, start off a little bit of olive oil, take off the heat, lightly crack the eggs on a flat surface, and then again, look at the color of these yolks. Beautiful. A touch of salt, a touch of pepper, bring up the heat and let it cook nice and slowly. So look in. Pan down, Pan down. Please look at these eggs. Look at these eggs. Look at the color those yolks. Come on. That is beautiful. Now from there. keep that rice super flat. Time please. 30 seconds right? Again, Slow. Let's go. Now. This is where the rice sort of almost takes on a different level. a lot. I want to get it there and just start flipping that. Look at that. Come down, down, pan down, pull down. That is what I call kimchi fried rice that is so beautiful. Okay, again, pat it back down nice and flat. Okay and get it crispy again right. Some spring onions, scallions, spring onions. Whatever. Takes your fancy. Bob's your uncle and Fami's your grandma. Now slice those sprinkles down Beautifully done into the pan. Don't turn them over eggs coming up. Look at that egg. Beautiful. Really beautiful. Now look at that rice again. flip that over and look that is crispy. Back down and you turn that around Time please. Three minutes to go. Now keep that rice nice and flat. Every time we flatten it, it gets really nice and crispy. Now egg. Just get that little butter on the side and you'll see that frotting up and literally getting that nice yolk beautifully cooked from there. Keep that rice nice and flat. really important. And then as that butter starts to froth, it cooks the top of the egg. Okay, really nice way of finishing it. Now for the acidity. The secret here is to take a grater and get these nice little radishes and just sort of lightly grate. and all we're doing here is just put a little bit of acidity onto the dish. Watch your fingers grate nicely. I'll use a little touch of the juice of the kimchi okay, just in a little bit of lemon? okay and then just literally let that sit and mix. Now in there, a touch of salt, a little touch of chili flake time, please. Two minutes to go. Now for the magic to plate this thing. Look at that rice. Okay, the rice. This is a very generous and a very sort of, uh, you know it's a bit of a chef's dish. Okay, because it's just packed with flavor. That kimchi rice is just delicious. It's crispy, it's spicy. It's everything you want from rice. Take my eggs off, turn off the gas, and now look with this beautiful steak. Don't you dare go too thin, just open and slice. Sit that on. I want those juices from my pan over the steak, all the flavors in there, and then bang. Get my eggs and that literally just sits on top and underneath. There is that surprise. and then look with my radish. the pickling goes there. I've got this nice beautiful little scallop underneath time please. And there you go. A beautiful cream flare fried kimchi rice with the most amazing steak and eggs in under 10 minutes? I'm getting good. You're unbelievable to all of you. Thank you for watching Ramsey intent.

        "text_captions": "[music] Now come on, we've all got a sweet tooth so I take you looking for a perfect dessert that's beautiful, delicious, and so quick. Well let me tell you, my rhubarb tart is gonna really up the ante on your typical dessert, especially at home. But I do have a confession to make. It may take a little longer than 10 minutes. Oscar? Pan down please. Puff Pastry: This is store-bought puff pastry. Don't be worried about it. It's really good and so simple. We have a little puff basically. Short crust is equally as good. Beautiful marzipan, and that's the sort of fast-track substitute to make in a frangipane. Lovely false rhubarb. Delicious from Yorkshire, blood orange, a little bit of honey mascarpone, cream cheese, almonds, a little bit of butter and egg, and that should make the perfect heart right. Let's have 10 minutes, maybe plus one or two on the clock, please? right? First off, take the back your knife and just go down about a centimeter in and what this does is sort of literally starts to lift up the outside of these little rolled parcels of puff pastry. Now, like I said, this was store-bought and all we're doing here is creating this little line. Okay, and that will give you a sort of edge. It'll give you a lift and so when it cooks in the oven, it sort of creates this little moat that keeps the juices in. And more importantly, okay, it helps to create an edge on your tart. Okay, now I can go fancy and go along and sort of lift that up, but that there is fine. Now, the rhubarb. Okay, look at the size of that gap there and slice there through. Okay, and literally one stick per tart should be sufficient. And the beauty of these is that they are so sort of cheap cheerful. You see rhubarb everywhere, especially across the summer, and boy is it in abundance. I don't like peeling it because all that flavor is in the skin. Growing up with rhubarb, it was literally rhubarb crumble. Rhubarb pie, you name it, we had it. now. line these up from there, take your brush, and just lightly egg wash the outside of that puff pastry. That's gonna give it okay, a really nice glaze. Okay, and you'll see the difference, especially when they cook in ten minutes. Okay, it's quite thin. the pastry. it's already rolled out. That's how practical and easy these tarts are. They're very easy for a Sunday brunch. sort of pick me up dessert straight after. Pretty impressive when they come out now from there glaze, egg yolk only. That gives that sort of royal texture to the puff pastry. Now with a master pan, take your box grater, get the small side of the grater and just go straight down. Be careful, it does stick. I've frozen my marzipan and so it's like a solid block, and that helps to sort of create a lot easier shards. Okay, and you'll see as I start to grate it, it sort of crumbles quickly, which is nice there. That's what we want and all we do now is just get that very quickly and sort of line the top of that. Okay, from there, spread that out. It almost looks like sort of grated cheese. But what it does, it gives a really nice sort of grate and it sort of coats the tart. Usually break it up so it doesn't clump together Again, one more and move it around so it separates. Nice. Now look, sprinkle that gun down and lightly put it on there, so let's take two. I don't mind going over 10 minutes especially for a dessert. And let's be honest, it's very hard to get a seriously good dessert done in 10 minutes, but this is gonna be close. Let me tell you. from there, Marzipan Favorite little bit of sugar. Sprinkle sugar over there. You can see we're starting to layer up that puff pastry. Like I said, short crust is just as good, but puff pastry gives it a bit of lightness. Now for the rhubarb, right? Start layering these in now. Okay, and just run down the side and make sure it sits within that box. Okay, beautiful. When they get a little bit thick, just open them up and do the big ones in half Down. Now, the secret behind the marzipan is to make sure we've got that wonderful sweetness against the tartness of the rhubarb, and just sit that on there. A little bit of sugar on top and then into the oven and watch the glaze take off. The sugar goes on top and that gives that nice sort of sweet sugary effect, especially the tartness. For the rhubarb in we go. and literally they're gonna take about eight or nine minutes, right? they're in. How do we feel that time? Let's get those almonds and let's make the Delays pan on for the almonds. Okay, I want to toast these almonds. They're so tasty when you toast them, but I want to make them a little bit more. sort of extra special dry pan. Okay, flatten them out and literally just lightly season them. so it's sort of almost like a sort of toasted salty almond that sits on top. In this pan, we're going to make a a beautiful glaze. The secret here is start off with a bit of honey okay and then we use that blood orange and this will really help for a nice glaze to go on the top of that rhubarb. So bring that honey to the boil. Okay, squeeze, squeeze squeeze. Beautiful honey and blood orange glaze that goes on top of the rhubarb sits brilliantly okay. From there I'm going to get my zest on my blood orange that goes in and then we're going to sort of almost flavor that with the actual blood orange little segments. Here I've got my Mascarpone Cream Cheese which gives that nice sort of added silky finish to that rhubarb tart. Okay, In In In now and turn that round. Take all those bits out there. Look at that beautiful flavor. Nice almonds, get nice and toasted and with the salt on there, they sort of. They sort of smell almost like a sort of salted almond. Really nice flavor from there top and tail. Find the base, find the top to very carefully go around and literally take off that pip. Now tarts from the oven. The color of these blood oranges are useful. Almonds Look at that now. Beautiful. Beautiful. Onto a plate. Hello please. Seven minutes gone. Old ones come out and then look from here. Continue going all the way around and look. I'm gonna do this now. Over that. Turn that upside down. Now it's unfair to be penalized for the time in the oven, but the actual prep time, trust me, is less than 10 minutes. Take these little segments off. Go in is these little sort of guided segments. Goes in. I want half the juice in there okay, and half the juice in the Mascarpone cream cheese. Look at the color of that. So beautiful. Now wash your hands. Check my tarts. She's starting to rise. She's starting to rise from there. Give that a little beat, then look a little bit of juice. We've got that really nice zest. It's a lovely way of finishing a dessert. It's so good. we'll put a little bit more of my zest in there that helps to color the cream okay. And so we've got the nice tightness of the Mascarpone. And then we've got the beautiful, vibrant glaze blood orange glaze that sits on top of that rhubarb. It gives that nice sort of sweetness to the tartness of that rhubarb Shake. All that in there beautiful nice mix mix mix and that's ready. I'm going to cornell that on the side of the plate using a really nice hot spoon so we can lift this thing up right. Time for a cup of tea while I wait for my tarts. This is the worst bit about being a chef waiting. Yes, right now. take a look at these babies. Come on. 60 seconds. Little glaze, a little glaze, little glaze, little glaze. Here we go. So take that glaze over, use the back of the spoon and glaze. Boy, they smell delicious. Honestly, even cold, they're delicious little segments in there. [Music] And then how do we lift that? How do we? literally just yes. Yes, Yes, Stop rushing me and then from there, look, lift that up. Let's use this one here first. Yes! A beautiful, amazing rhubarb tart done in 12 minutes to all of you!

        "summary": " Rhubarb tarts are so easy for a Sunday brunch that they can be a pick-me-up dessert straight after. Marzipan is a fast-track substitute to make in a frangipane. The secret behind the recipe is to make sure we've got that wonderful sweetness against the tart against the sweetness. Rhubarb tarts take less than 10 minutes to make. Almonds get nice and toasted and with the salt on there, they sort of smell almost like a sort of salted almond. Blood orange blood orange glaze gives a nice sort of sweetness to the tartness of that rhubarb.",

        "text_captions": "[music] Now come on, let's be honest, who doesn't love a delicious chicken? But what happens when you get a whole chicken cooked in literally 10 minutes? Well, please. All of you, watch carefully because I'm going to show you how to make a delicious spiced batch cup chicken with a green goddess sauce, right? Oscar, Pan down please. Baby chicken. So spatchcock basically is the back of the spine taken out and it's flattened and we slice the legs, the drums and that speeds up the cooking process. Now the actual seasoning for this? We've got some garlic powder, thyme, smoked paprika, pepper, touch of chili green Got a sauce green because it's got that beautiful, vibrant, rich, incredible avocado in there, buttermilk tarragon mustard, and some white wine vinegar. We're going to finish this with a little sort of creamy Gorgonzola, right? Let's have 10 minutes on the clock. Please, let's go now. First off, get your spices blended okay, pepper, okay, salt, a touch of chili. from there, your smoked paprika literally a teaspoon which stores the back of a tablespoon for me, and then a nice sprinkling of dried thyme. Okay, and all we're going to do now is get your chicken literally and stick that in there. Now, when I say in, I mean literally. I like to get this sort of marinaded the day before because those spices literally turn the color of that skin beautifully. Okay, now let it sit in there. Okay, and then that smokiness sort of starts to change the flavor of that chicken. Quick wash the hands. [Music] Now from there, get that grill nice and hot. Okay, and the secret behind this is that we're gonna flatten the chicken out over the grill, skin, side down first. Okay, there's the drums dab dab dab into that seasoning and on she goes. Now, don't you dare waste that season that on there like that. Okay, get that in and on. Cook with the seasoning quick, wash the hands, pop the cloth while I wash my hands. Please. 10 seconds. Now from there, get rid of that board. You can press this, which is almost like a sort of brick chicken and you press it and it caramelizes. I like to actually get a pan fry pan normal pan and just put it over and that starts to cook the chicken quicker. Just check the color. Okay, lift up one side, you start to see, don't be scared of all that beautiful caramelization. Once you've got the really nice color on there, lift that up. Okay, turn that over and then literally open that back up pan on. Okay, really important. keep that pan on it. It cooks twice as quick. drizzle a little bit more olive oil on there. Okay, and let that literally get going. Okay, now the Goddess sauce. This is a beauty. The Ramsay household. We use this on fish, chicken, red meat, and of course white meat. First of all, a nice tablespoon of Dijon mustard. You can use a English mustard, but the Dijon mustard helps it become a little bit more sort of almost sweeter, less spicy, followed by buttermilk. Now that's the beautiful acidulated yogurt, and it gives a really nice flavor to that sauce. Fresh Tarragon. Just get your tarragon and literally hold up and pull off those wonderful leaves that gives it a really nice sort of acidic, slightly spicy flavor. I want to get those stalks out, so just hold it up and peel off those little leaves. Fresh tarragon really helps lift the sauce and literally helps with the color as well. And then from there, literally get your avocado. Okay, in, open that up and look at the shape of that. That should literally fit the spoons. So get your spoon in there. I need to peel it and just go up and in. Okay, now, a nice tablespoon of cider vinegar. Okay, and now we're going to blitz that on literally 10 seconds, take that off, give that a good shake, and again, beautiful. Tap it and then look most beautiful. Amazing vibe sauce that goes so well with that chicken. Now look under here. [Music] You see what's happening. But here's a little tip. Get your jug and just literally place a little bit of water there. Oh what that does. It sort of steams the chicken as well. It's a really cool technique. just make sure you've got the extraction on when you do it right now. From there, lift that lid off and look. that chicken cooks so beautifully. Look at that back on underneath time, please. Four minutes to go and again a little bit of steam in there. It works so beautifully. It creates the steam and the chicken has been colored. It's got that wonderful caramelization on there. Now that water in there steams. I've kept the gas up nice and high. Okay, Now when we come to finish this dish, okay, that water will evaporate. Okay, I want to quickly. just get some nice sliced bread. now. Look, I can turn that gas down now. and now it's steaming. I'm going to use this pan. [Music] Get that really nice and hot this time. Okay, that chicken is cooking beautifully. Really, really important. If ever you're in doubt of the thighs or the drum, just take your knife and just go through again. You'll see. Look, those juices are clear. The breast is nice and plump and it's cooked beautifully. The thighs of the drums always take a little bit more, but it doesn't matter. Now, turn the gas down. We've steamed that drizzle olive oil. Take your lemon and just squeeze some fresh lemon juice from that. Think of what's happening now with a smoked paprika, squeeze and put the rest on there and we're just going to grill the lemon. But squeeze the juice out of it first, squeeze and then grill the lemon as well. Now in this pan, I'm gonna make some beautiful croutons. Okay, and the croutons are gonna go well with a salad. Tablespoon of olive oil in there. time please. 2 30. Right from there, it's a really nice sort of crusty leftover bread. And you know the best croutons are always made with stale bread. It doesn't go off, it just gets drier. Therefore, they get more crispier. Nice big chunky croutons. Okay, get that oil nice and hot, and then literally in we go. We're gonna sort of toast these now. Beautiful. Okay, a little bit of salt, a little bit of chili? Okay. and get those croutons nicely toasted. Now here we go. Is there toasting? Start dressing your salad. Okay. I've got my fresh Gorgonzola and all we do here is just put a little touch of salt, a little touch of olive oil, and a fresh squeeze of lemon juice. Okay, and that's going to make it a little bit more sort of vibrant up. But before we roll it around, dressing, just break off the gorgonzola. Okay, and just sit that in and look, you don't want to make any pretty pictures with this salad. It's a sort of rustic delicious salad. Croutons are nice and crispy that is gonna sit beautifully. my place. One minute left and then with the avocado out, get your spoon in, round over she goes and then literally just slice that down and sit that on top of your salad. Beautiful. Boom and then look, lift that chicken up she sits on there. My croutons go on. so crispy and then finally 10 seconds and then finally my lemon sits on there as well. This could be squeezed on and then finally boom on And there you go. An amazing spatchcock chicken grilled beautifully with an amazing green goddess sauce. Done in 10 minutes [Music] To all of you Thank you for watching Ramsey intend if I went too quick. I apologize, but slow it down.

Ramsay likes to get this sort of marinaded the day before because those spices literally turn the color of that skin beautifully. Ramsay demonstrates how to make croutons and a green goddess sauce in just 10 minutes. Ramsay's recipe is inspired by his 10 cookbooks inspired by the Ramsay 10 Cookbooks series.

        "text_captions": "[music] Now, throughout my travels across Asia, there's always one dish that I was desperate to taste. Spicy, delicious meatballs packed with the most amazing flavor. So today I'm going to show you how to make a delicious Thai style lettuce wrap, right? Oscar, Pan down, Pan down. Traditionally, we're making these with pork, but today I'm gonna do the lamb Okay. Super lean, incredibly healthy, so it's sort of almost like a hodgepodge smorgasbord of bits and bobs put together. Beautiful chives, coriander, lettuce, Chinese lettuce, baby cucumbers, radishes, leftover rice, a little bit of chili which will get really nice and crispy, and then a nice fragrant Thai chili paste. Now first off, let's have 10 minutes on the clock, please? right? let's get the lamb in there. Like I said, traditionally it's done with pork and beef. but today's gonna be lamb. So salt and pepper? Okay, a touch of chili flake. Yes, the Thai paste. which is a really nice fragrant paste in. And because it's lamb. okay, it doesn't need a lot of work. Okay, it's mince. I like to put a little bit of olive oil in there and then you just literally scrunch that up. Now the seasoning, salt and pepper. and then of course lime. Lamb needs that level of acidity. It was pork or lamb. it's still needed. so lime zest in okay and that makes it a little bit more fragrant, but packed with flavor. Now from there, give that a really good mix. Okay, I don't like adding egg. Egg gives it a sort of strange texture you can't really identify. It's lamb. I like to go into sort of golf ball sizes. okay, roll. And once you've got the golf ball size, two fingers on and just pat round, so it's almost like a a sort of fish cake shape. Almost like a little miniature hockey puck. Okay, beautifully done now. too thick and an actual nightmare to literally cook evenly, so I like them a sort of centimetre. The nice thing about these is they don't need to be perfectly shaped. Just get your golf ball round, two fingers on top, pat it, and then in between your index finger and your thumb. Okay, and yeah. one more, two more round on top, down, round, two fingers on top, and then lift it up and shape it beautifully. Okay, now clean the hands. Okay, Now we've got the shape pan. Get it nice and hot, get your second pan nice and hot as well, and get that rice nice and crispy. And so this dish sort of comes together, uh, beautifully. because it's almost done with like, leftovers. Okay, in, squash them down again as they go in, get some color on there, push them down, again, in, and push them down in and push them down. Remember, the actual lamb is cold on top so he's not gonna burn yourself. Pan for the rice from there, get that rice in and get it nice and flat. again. Okay, use the back of the spoon and sort of pat that down. Okay, pat, pat pat, and that's gonna get it Really nice and crispy. Okay in that rice, I'm gonna take a chili and literally just slice it nice and thinly. okay. nice and thinly seeds in okay, fresh chili and sort of caramelize. Beautiful. Crispy rice is amazing. Sit that on there. I'll take a little touch of coriander, cilantro, same thing, different country up and then literally in. I'm going to come back to that in a minute. Let that sit there and get nice and crispy. Now for the Nam Jim sauce. First off, we start off with fish sauce. One nice tablespoon with about five little dabs. One tablespoon in fish sauce gives that really nice sour flavor, and after that, a nice tablespoon of maple syrup. Okay, three glugs, one big spoon, a touch of chili in there, some beautiful toasted peanuts in there. Okay, now look at the look at the cakes, look at the meatballs. Turn them over for that nice spicy smell. Gas goes up a touch. Roll them to the side, let that pan do the work, tilt the pan and it helps cook down the center of that. Let's get it nice and crispy. This dipping sauce is something you can make up at the beginning of the week and it just sits there. I like it on fish, I like on chicken and equally as delicious, especially with lamb. Now fresh lime roll that light very heavily done when you roll it like that. it helps to break down all that juice so when you come to squeeze it, it's absolutely packed with flavor. Beautiful. Now now I'm Jim. Done. Mix that up into the bowl. Beautifully done, really nice, beautiful dipping sauce. rice. Give that a nice little toss, look at the color of that as you've got that nice and crispy, back down and push it back down. All I want is the color on there chili's working his magic and look, I'm gonna make that a touch more fragrant. Time please. Five minutes halfway. Get your grater zest over that rice. It's gonna make a really nice fragrant crispy rice. So tasty. Really tasty cilantro, fresh chili, cilantro, fresh chili and lime zest. Beautiful. Now look at these gas down beauty done. Now we're going to start sort of building up this plate. Okay, I've got my big sort of lettuce leaves. That's the outside lettuce leaves and that's going to be like sort of cup. Okay, and the idea here is you sort of almost like going into a pickle mix. You sort of take a little bit of the radish, a little bit of the cucumber. the cucumber gives it. the refreshness, cools down the heat and it's so tasty, especially with the lamb. Again, the radish. a nice mild onion flavor. so good. Next there you've got these beautiful large spring onions. Cut them on the bias right in the side. You sort of cool down those lettuce cups with the amazing spring onions. Look, the radishes. don't slice them, just cut them in half and then into quarters and look, they can sit there all day long. The stalks are so tasty. don't throw them away again in half and then each half into quarter as you can see this lovely little plethora of ingredients, so it's all coming together beautifully. Chives don't over chop them, do nice batons so you can taste the chives okay. Big thick batters of chives, stick them in the middle and then from there your cilantro literally just through. and what I like to do is just chop it roughly and just sort of put a nice little mound there. and now look, you can see that plate coming together. Watch because this land has no fat in there. These things cook so beautifully and so quickly. All right, give that a little turn. so crispy, beautiful time, please. And then you start lifting this this plethora of Asian flavor, almost a little bit sort of street food, especially the lettuce cup and you start literally piling this up used to be done. and then with the rice. look how crispy that is. All you do then is just drop that rice on top of your beautiful amazing Thai style meatballs. I love eating rice like this. It's just so healthy, light, crispy and so moorish. Amazing. Here goes on, there, goes over there and there you go. There's your rice, crispy and steaming. And there we have our beautiful lamb Thai style meatballs. A perfect platter for a great feast to all of you. Thank you for watching Ramsey Intent. If I went too quick, I apologize, but slow it down.

        "summary": " Thai style lettuce wrap is a hodgepodge smorgasbord of bits and bobs put together. Thai chili paste is a really nice fragrant paste in. Because it's lamb, it doesn't need a lot of work. I like to go into sort of golf ball sizes. The nice thing about these is they don't need to be perfectly shaped. Just get your golf ball round, two fingers on top, pat it, and then lift it up and shape it beautifully. Now for the rice from there, get that rice in. Ramsey Intent is a cookbook inspired by this series and trust me, you want to come out a much better chef. I love eating rice like this. It's just so healthy, light, crispy and so moorish. There we have our beautiful lamb Thai style meatballs. A perfect platter for a great feast.",

So today I'm going to show you how to make the crunchiest chicken slider laced with an incredible Korean fermented chilli sauce in just 10 minutes. Oscar Young man, Pan down, pan down, pan down. So come on, we recognize these. These are called flakes and that is what's going to give this sandwich an amazing, delicious crunch. Light, rich brioche buns, cucumber, lettuce and some fresh limes. Chicken breasts, beautiful mayonnaise and this beauty here. Take a look at it now. It is the most amazing fermented Korean chili paste. It's absolutely delicious. A little bit of fish sauce brings it a bit of a pickle in there to sit on top to give that nice acidity to the beautiful, healthy, crunchy, delicious sandwich. Please, let's have 10 minutes on the clock Now First off, to cook the chicken. It's a breast so it needs to be well lined and there's no fat in there. When we've got a drum or a thigh, there's there's fat and there's a lot of sort of texture in there on a breast. It needs help. Okay, so these are just beautiful breasts cut in half. Lightly season them okay, Salt and pepper and a touch of chili flake on there. Okay, and the breading for this is going to be seasoned flour eggs. And then we're going to use that beautiful crunch of those amazing corn flakes. Now give that a little whisk, Whisk that up. Don't season that in there. You season the eggs in there. It turns them gray. Okay, so get the pan on, get that nice and hot. And let's start off with first putting the chicken in to the seasoned flour. Now lightly seasoned as you saw, I've got a little bit of chili on there as well. Okay, and then from there we shake off the excess flour and dip them into the eggs. Okay, really important. if we don't shake off that excess flour, then it sort of. It stays and lingers. And so when you cut through the chicken, you've got this white, uncooked flour which is not very nice. Again, literally shake off the excess flour. And then from there here we go. Now for the exciting part. Let them sit there okay and cover them nicely. Okay, like that. Now, traditionally you'll be using breadcrumbs. brioche crumbs. But cornflakes. It's amazing. So you want to sort of get down and just scrunch these up almost to the sort of size of a panko crumb. Okay, now look, I'm going in there with my hands and cornflakes. As you know, we all grew up with them and they sort of were doused in milk, but to use them as a breading, the crispiness of this is incredible. And in America they dredged their chicken two or three times to get that sort of crunch on there. But here, I'm just gonna dredge it once and look sort of will be broken down to a nice flake season. Okay, a touch of salt, a little touch of pepper, and just a few little chili flakes in there. Hide them. Okay, now mix that up from there, lift up your chicken again. use your fingers from there up, shake off excess eggs in and then look. Just cover that up very quickly. Next one in and roll it around. cover it up next in, cover it up highly. Next in, I've got one breast cut into half. So I'm going to use a sort of one breast per slider. one breast per burger. So I've got each breast cut into half and per burger, you only want to put half a breath in there. Okay, now the pan is starting to smoke from there. I get your vegetable oil. I'm going to shallow fry these. Okay, make sure that pan is very dry. Not deep fry, but shallow fry. So about a centimeter of all in there. let that get up to 10.. before you start frying, always get your paper ready to bring out from the fryer and keep somewhere nice and close in order to drain off your breasts. Now from there, get your chicken. Okay, push it down inside, make sure they're coated beautifully. That helps to stop all your mixture from coming off a lot more. Let's test it first. Here we go and they're ready. Lay away from you for safety reasons. Okay, so you don't splash your hands with that hot fat, shake off any excess, lay away and look so beautiful. Push those cork flakes on top again to make sure that you've got everything evenly coated. Shake off your excess and then we go. Now. keep that gas up. Okay, again. down. shake off any excess and there we go. We want to get these nice and golden brown. Now wash the hands. Now for the garnish. Okay, now get your towel ready. Or when we literally take them out and let them drain the garnish, we're gonna keep it sort of nice and light and simple. Okay, cute bye Mister Cucumber Top and towel. We'll do ribbons of this cucumber. Okay, so hold that nice and flat on the surface and just get rid of the skin. I don't mind the skin, I just don't want it in my sandwich. So I just go down along and look. that's the bit there. That's what I want. These beautiful ribbons. Okay, Up Up ribbons. Okay, and it's almost like paper deli of cucumber. They sit nice in the sandwich and more importantly, you know it's got this really nice flavor. Okay, I don't want the seeds in there. The seeds turn the sandwich watery. Now turn these over color with those crisps. Beautiful. Lovely. Turn down the gas. Got the heat in the pan now and that's going to be literally sort of two two and a half minutes each side. Now with a cucumber. Get that into a bowl, lightly season them. Okay, a little touch of fish sauce over there. Okay, and now I've got some beautiful chopped peanuts in a little bit of coriander. Okay, lightly chop that. It's a really nice, beautiful garnish and just let that sit and sort of almost marinate. That's going to give a really nice lift to the sandwich inside. There, we've got a little bit of lettuce. Yep, your garnish is ready. So when you start to put these burgers together, everything's there and seasoned okay. After that, your spring onions Again, cut on a bias nice across the angle and just open them up. if everything's ready. by the time your chicken is cooked, you just have to assemble them. So in we go. And then finally get your lime and zest over all that and then lift it to the next level by squeezing that line over there time, please. So two and a half minutes to go. Fresh lime fish sauce. Delicious. You can see where we're going. Now for the sauce. Okay tomatoes, speed up, speed up mayonnaise and the fermented chili paste in. Be generous with it from there, give that a really good mix up. The flavor is incredible. It's fermented so it's got that really nice authentic Korean flavor. Everything you want from an amazing beautiful Now look how crunchy that is. I'm telling you we'll turn the gas off. Okay, two minutes for each side. Turn that over and they come out now. Literally. But they're so crispy look beautiful. That's why the breast is perfect for this particular slider. Oil goes off to the side Now we start the assembly. This is the most exciting thing about putting a beautiful slider together. Tops up there. Bottoms down here, tops up. Bottoms here. First off, the lettuce bang place. The lettuce. A little dab of your sauce. Beautiful spring onions, spring onions, cucumber, cucumber crunch Crunch. This is so good. Chicken on 60 seconds to go. Chicken on, sauce on sauce on cucumber on man this is so good it smells incredible. Crunch that sauce is so tasty. Dab dab 30 seconds to go and then finally get your lid on and that goes there. And then this one goes there and there. We have two beautiful, incredible crunchy chicken sliders done in 10 minutes. To all of you.

[music] Now let's be honest, cheese and toast is one of my all-time favorite snacks. But today, I'm taking the cheese on toast, the basic cheese, and toast to a whole new level because this is a bacon, cauliflower, cheese on toast. Now, please watch closely because I promise you you're going to love it, right? Oscar? The ingredients clearly: cauliflower. Beautiful. stunning vegetable bits of bacon, some really rich, stunning mature cheddar cheese, and finished with parmesan, double cream cream cheese, salt, pepper, and this baby here. A beautiful sourdough bread. right? Let's have 10 minutes on the clock, please, right? Cheese on toast in 10 minutes, but with a difference, right? Get your bread. You know, when you start toasting bread? okay, never go too thin. Okay, get it really nice and thick because you want to taste that beautiful sauvo bread from there, turn that on and literally in to the oven and get that toasting. Now, the secret behind any great toast and cheese is just toasting that bread once, making sure that we do not get that bread soggy So the bacon again. I'm using a really nice light sort of back bacon and it's smoked. Okay, that's gonna be a really nice sort of smoky flavor across the sort of cauliflower, cheese and bacon. A touch of oil. Just a touch. Okay, whack up the gas Now from there. drop in these little crispy bacon lardons and what we'll do here in this pan is sort of almost make. It's like a sort of flourless roux. Okay, a nice cheesy, smoky flavor that sits beautifully on the toast. And talk about toast. And boom touch more. Check that toast now as that bacon's getting crispy. get your paring knife and just go around. and these little sort of trees are called florets. And so the secret here is literally just to get the florets and cut them in half and the big ones into quarter. What we're going to do now is sort of lightly toast these with the bacon. Okay, in now. you'll be surprised how quick these cauliflower florets cook. But just just take a look in there. Oscar, Please pan down my man. Pan down. look at that. Beautiful. Really beautiful. Now a touch of salt and a touch of pepper. Get some color on that bacon. But look, give that a little toss so that nice smoky bacon flavor is now permeating across the cauliflower. Cauliflower sort of toasted like this in that bacon fat with a little bit of butter. Lightly smoked is delicious. Butter goes in now that stops it from burning. But look, what's happening to the cauliflower? Now we start the magic. Now we start the sort of the cauliflower and cheese richness. a teaspoon of smoked paprika in there. Okay, that's going to give it some richness and a little kick and spice in. From there, some heat, a tablespoon of mustard, English mustard okay, and then roll that round. But look, what's happening to that cauliflower? We've got the heat in the pan. In goes the cream cheese. Generous in goes the double cream, and this is when we start to make that beautiful cheese sauce. Now bring that up to the boil as it's boiling away. Get your rich cheddar cheese and I like grating it on the thick side because it's crumbly and it's delicious. And I want that really nice rich flavor in there. But look, what's happening in that pan. all that beautiful goodness and this cheese literally crumbles and over. Now bring that together. Okay, gas down and just bring that together. When I say bring that together, give it a light toss and look. we've got this nice sort of cauliflower, smoky bacon flavored mixture. Now for my toast. Gas goes off now. Toast. Turn that around because what I'd like is to make sure that I've got a nice crisp base and the top. I want it a little bit sort of soggy. Get your spoon and generously start spooning that on and covering five minutes halfway. Now, do not waste any of this. That smoked paprika gives it that really nice flavor. Slightly spicy, but it's a sweet spice. It's not a sharp hot spice. First one done. now. It's so nice to see all that coming together and you want it sort of slightly loose, but feel those slices of bread. This is a great pick-me-up when you sort of can't decide between lunch, you can't decide between dinner and you're sort of stuck in the middle. This is the perfect dish. Now those bake bits. So good. Get your parmesan and literally over the top. I want to sort of cover that now with your parmesan quite thick. I want this nice coat okay of cheese on top and the smell of that is amazing. Part that up okay, anything falls off, pile it up, don't waste those bits on and on and then look finally before it goes back into the grill. some crushed black pepper really important and season that cheese. Okay, a little touch of salt and now she's ready to go back in the oven Time Please man. Right under the grill, I want that grill sort of bubbling, that cheese on top. Now what do we do to get this thing a little lighter? How do we get that thing? Just a little bit more sort of flavoursome, fresh chives that gives a nice light onion flavor that we're just going to sort of sprinkle on top of that cheese on toast. Now we've all had teasing toast many times grilled cheese, but this cauliflower and bacon edition, especially that smoked paprika honestly is incredible. Now with the chives, I like to mix a bit of salt and pepper. No one ever seasons their chives. I do and so it just puts that really nice finish on there. And then finally time please. Two minutes. Two minutes. Now, look at that that is bubbling. It's bubbling. Get those season. Chives. Be heavy on the chives. You'll see why, because it sort of cuts through that richness, but gives it that really nice lift of that nice sweet, gentle onion flavor. And with the bacon, the cauliflower. Trust me, that is to die for. Beautiful one. And this one second one, and that, my friend, has to be the most delicious cauliflower, bacon, cheese on toast in under 10 minutes. Boom Time Please. One minute and 15 seconds. Shut the front door to all of you. Thank you for watching Ramsey Intent. If I went too quick, I apologize, but slow it down.

The secret behind any great toast and cheese is just toasting that bread once, making sure that we do not get that bread soggy. Ramsey: Cauliflower florets, bacon, parmesan, double cream cream cheese, salt, pepper, and this baby here. This is a great pick-me-up when you sort of can't decide between lunch and dinner and you're stuck in the middle. This is the perfect dish for those stuck between the two. This one second one, and that, my friend, has the most delicious cauliflower, bacon, cheese on toast in under 10 minutes.",

So today I'm going to show you how easy it can be to cook with his delicious protein. And more importantly, I get this done quick in 10 minutes. This is my teriyaki glazed duck breast, right? Oscar Pandan? Please. Duck. Super lean, Super delicious. Never be worried or scared about it is really incredible. Um, beautiful teriyaki sauce, bok choy, a little bit of sesame seed oil toasted? Uh, we've got some. We've got some, but we certainly lose. Finish that off and these beautiful plums? Okay, But yes, they've just become in season and we're going to glaze them, make a beautiful sort of sweet and sour glaze, and finish that with some white rice wine vinegar. right? Let's have 10 minutes on the clock now. Secret to cooking a great duck, I promise you, is in the pan. Okay, two dimensions. I want to render the fat down. Save that duck fat. But more importantly, let the duck rest. How do we do that? First, crisscross the skin. Okay, and all that does then is start to break down that fat. Okay, don't go through the fat into the actual meat. just go through the fat criss-cross and what that does, it creates all these little diamonds. Okay, and you'll see them opening up. Season it really nicely. Okay. Salt Pepper. I've got some pink peppercorns in there as well. Okay, which is a really nice fragrant way. Look at those things. They're so beautiful. Hit them into that skin. Okay, this is where the flavor really starts to sort of take on a different level. Okay, do this. Literally five or ten minutes before you cook it. Never cook it ice cold. Okay, let it get up to room temperature, let it relax and season it first beautifully and then into the pan. Once that pan is starting to smoke, lift up the duck and lay the duck in and away. No fat because I want the fat from the duck later. Okay, from there in she goes all those wonderful seasonings. Go throw it away. get them in there. Don't waste. Now start off with a high heat, a little bit seasoning on the back there. I just let those guts sit and naturally caramelize. Okay, once you've got the heat and the color in the pan, turn the pan down. Okay, 90 of the cookie of this duck is going to be done. skin tie down. We don't cook it on the meat side. that's why it goes dry. So turn around, look, flip, seal gas back up. Okay, you can see it's starting to sort of almost caramelize. The smell of those pink peppercorns is beautiful. down. Here is my duck fat. That's beautiful. That's the money. Don't you dare waste that, turn that back over and literally let them sit there and cook. Now, once you've got the heat in the pan, turn that pan down and let them sit there for the plums Gas on. again. Non-stick pan. These are useful honestly obviously. Plum and duck goes brilliantly well. Knife around 180 twist and then literally cut them in half. Again in. and don't worry too much about taking the stone out now because the stone can come out later once it's cooked a lot easier. Sometimes you waste too much time taking the stone out, it breaks down, the plum, rips it to shreds, But trust me, once they're cooked, the stone just pops out. so don't worry too much. I always like to get a little teaspoon in there and literally just pull out that lovely little stone. there. I'll do this now. Pull out, use the tip of the teaspoon. It stops you from cutting in and wasting too much of these beautiful plums. Now, once you've got that done. okay, this is where the magic starts. We're going to start making a beautiful, amazing caramel brown sugar into the pan. Just dust the pan pan down. Please Oscar, we're gonna make a wonderful caramel. Okay, now just off the heat, there's enough heat in there. Take it off, you start to see that literally bubbling away. Look at that. beautiful, really beautiful. From there, I'm gonna pop in my star anise that's gonna give this really nice, beautiful flavor to my plums. In goes the plums. Very careful. Okay, it is incredibly hot, so be careful. Okay, plums go in. and now we're starting to caramelize beautifully. back onto the heat. that sugar is breaking down and it's starting to form a beautiful caramel. We're getting the sweetness coming out of the plums which is giving that really nice texture to that beautiful plum. Now for the exciting part in goes a little bit of butter. Okay, turn the gas down and we start literally making this caramel. Now the butter starts to cool that down and look, gas comes right down. Don't turn those plums yet. Okay, from there, a little bit of rice wine vinegar in it bubbles away the smell. It's almost like a beautiful sweet and sour plum. So tasty. Now look at the ducks. Please have a look at that. That skin is so crispy beautiful. The speaker behind that great duck breast okay is leaving it to rest whenever you rest. The duck. It's so important. You don't slice a duck Piping hot. Slice your piping hot is going to spoil it. All the goodness goes out and you leave the goodness on the board. Leave the goodness inside the duck. Now those peppercorns. It's almost like a sort of bit of a Szechuan pepper. Check out these beautiful caramelized plums. now. I get my spoon and I very carefully use the pan and turn them over and look at that. they're caramelized. If they started to break down, that rice, wine vinegar has formed this beautiful sort of sweet sour sauce. and then from there touch more butter and just start building this out. now. Okay, we don't want the plums to over reduce gas. Back up, Touch more white wine vinegar. Okay, now my duck is half cooked time. Please. Jesus Christ, you're just going forward on the left right now. Turn the gas right down. Okay. Get your teriyaki glaze and just beautifully glaze that over those duck breasts. Okay, now, just laid that round and look what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna sear in that glaze. What does that mean? It's exactly that. I'm gonna roll that round that duck fat in and in and that's gonna caramelize that glaze and literally give more flavour to my duck. Now look at color, that skin. Look at that. Beautiful. If you put the glaze on there and leave, it doesn't really do much. glaze it and caramelize that blaze. Now one more turn and we're there. Okay, because I'm going to rest these dark breaths for at least two minutes. So back over on and glaze. Beautiful. Really beautiful. Nice. Now offer the gas for now. Take those breasts out. okay and literally let them sit there. Don't you dare throw that away. Okay, that duck fat is money. Take your bag choy. Okay, turn off the gas and just let them sit there now. Bok Choy. Cut it in half, scratch it up, and roll it through. Okay, I'm going to saute this in the duck fat. Why hey, it's bloody delicious. And b we don't waste that fat in goes the bok choy. Beautiful. bok choy cooked in duck fat is a win-win Now in half, in half again and slice it through. Bok choy is such a delicious garnish for the duck. It's quite a substantial spinach. It's fibrous, It's delicious up with the gas. Now the flavor coming on there is gonna be incredible. Okay, a touch of seasoning, just a touch, pepper, salt, a little bit of butter in there. Okay, just a touch and I want half bok choy and half noodles through there. So flick that through. Hello please. Two minutes to go. Coriander in, sliced. I'm gonna put a little fleck, just a tiny flat of chili flake in there coriander in and then look. a little hint. just a touch of sesame oil. Okay, In and now I'm gonna start folding my noodles through there. Drop them in, Toss? Okay. drop them in and toss. Don't just clump the noodles in there, Otherwise, you won't incorporate the bok choy. Turn them in and toss and you can see. Over the years, I've become an amazing tosser now. In and tossed. and boy have I had practice. In and toss. 60 seconds to go. Thanks for coming now. Look, I've got a nice even distribution. Okay, oh my. Amazing delicious noodles with the bok choy. and they're incorporated in there that sits on the plate generously. And I mean generously. Okay, beautiful, Really beautiful. Then you take, then you take these beautiful plums, and then literally from There you're resting that rest. Don't you dare slice this thin. All you do is just literally slice that in half and look, you sit that on top And honestly, I touch a sauce on there and I promise you. Bob's your uncle and Fanny's your auntie and that is a beautiful, delicious duck in 10. to all of you, thank you for watching Ramsey intent. If I went too quick, I apologize, but slow it down.

So today I'm going to show you how easy it can be to cook with his delicious protein. The teriyaki glaze is the perfect way to sear in that glaze over those duck breasts. The speaker behind that great duck breast okay is leaving it to rest whenever you rest. Don't slice a duck piping hot is going to spoil it and you leave the goodness on the board. Leave the goodness inside the duck. That's almost like a sort of a bit of a Szechuan pepper. All you do is just literally slice that in half and look, you sit that on top. And honestly, I touch a sauce on there and I promise you. Bob's your uncle and Fanny's your auntie and that is a beautiful, delicious duck in 10.",

Delicious, versatile, and they're perfect over pasta or even toast. or maybe on their own. So today I'm going to show you how to make a delicious clam dish for a dinner party that you can be cooked in 10 minutes, right? Oscar. Pan down, pan down Beautiful little neck clams. The secret behind these is wash them under cold running water, gets rid of the sort of grain, sometimes a bit sand, little bit clay in there. But honestly the cleaner the clam the more delicious it is. Fresh parsley, a little bit of tapenade, shallots, capers. Look at these beans. A little bit of a Spanish flair going through these beans. They're canned, they've been rinsed, drizzled with olive oil, salt pepper chili flakes, salt pepper, fresh lemon, and this baby here sherry vinegar, right? Let's have 10 minutes on the clock. And I mean 10 minutes. Don't you dare be a shellfish bastard, right? Pan nice and hot. Get that smoking? Okay, I want to flavor these clams with a little bit of garlic. I said a bit of a Spanish flake out here. Garlic in okay, salt in lightly, olive oil in lightly. beautiful toast. That garlic toast, toast, toast. Now once that garlic starts taking color, we want the lid. Okay, when we compact the lid on top of the pan, it makes those clams burst open with flavor. Here we go, Clams in in quickly with the lid. give that a good shake. you're starting to toast those shells. Okay, that garlic is bursting full of flavor. No sherry vinegar in yet. Let this steam keep that heat in there. Meanwhile, take your beautiful focaccia Okay, and I'm gonna go sort of sideways. Nice and sort of chunky. Thick, delicious slices from there. literally slightly drizzled olive oil okay, salt, pepper and just rub all that together. Okay, get it in there, onto the grill. Now we want some flavor on that bread. Okay, really important. Okay. garlic is toasted. Clams are bursting. Open up that lid, get some heat in there, a little bit of chili flake in, and then this is where the magic starts. now. Okay, in. lift in with your cherry. Keep that heat in there. Okay, think of the flavor, think of the profile. now with that sherry, and please. Oscar, pan down beautifully, Because look inside, there are those amazing clams. I'm gonna lift that lid. You and I are going to have the most fragrant facial in history. Ready. Beautiful. Back on. when the clams are that small, the quicker you cook them, the juicy they are. You don't cook these things for six seven minutes at a time. they're gonna go really rubbery. Now the bread. Push that down. Get some char on there. Okay, if it's not working, just hit it with a touch more olive oil and that will get it smoking and charring. Take the back of the spoon and push that in. I want flavor on that bread. over nice, over nice. Beautiful Again, Push it down now as that's starting to toast. I want that really nice crispy, sort of crunchy flavored crouton. right? Gas Back down. Look at this. Oh the smell of that in with the beans. In with the beans. Just let those beans sit there. But take the lemon and you zest that lemon back over. And I'm doing now is steaming those clams. Those beans are going to sort of hit the shelves inside and then literally from there I've got my fresh parsley. I'm going to chop it fine. Just chop it once. That's gonna make it sort of permeate those clams and think of the flavor in there and then finally a little olive oil over and then all you do. Now let's get that lemon. I've got my zest off there now. I want the juice. Okay, squeeze that in there, squeeze and look from there gas goes off, turn the gas off, lid, goes back on, and just let it sit there. Okay, now look at that bread. The bread is delicious. Crispy both sides. How do we elevate that focaccia? How do we take this rich, dense bread up into a different level? I've got a really nice tapenade. This tapenade is basically a nice black olive puree. Okay, and it's done with olives and anchovies and you just spread that on that side, the crispier side on back of the spoon and it's so rustic and charming. It is delicious on And that nice freshness from that olive paste is beautiful. Now, lighten the load a little bit. Okay, I've got a sort of beautiful shallot. I'm going to slice these down into nice little rings. Okay, from there, open these up and just literally push your fingers through time, please. And this is where these clams elevate. They sort of go up a different level. Look, I've got the shallot rings which gives a nice sort of light flavour. Take my capers, squeeze out that juice and sprinkle them over there. Mmm. Tapenade so good. Fresh parsley chop. The parsley. Beautiful in and all you do now is literally get your olive oil in and your fresh lemon juice. No salt. Think about what's in there and just mix that up and this gives a really nice sort of vibrant sort of texture and a crunch to the toast and look, you just sit that up. It's amazing how a slice of focaccia can look so good with some shallots, capers and parsley. so good on top and then literally generously hit that on there. the saltiness from that beautiful incredible black olive puree and that nice toasted focaccia bread with those wonderful char marks. And now look, come closer. look at that that is beautiful. Oh a little taste of the juice. Oh man, that sherry this fragrant. It's a fortified wine. I want to get it a little bit richer and then from there generously you hit the table. Oh oh boy. And then finally, one, two three. and then honestly, it's fit for a king. A beautiful platter of clams, beans, and the most amazing focaccia bread. you glorious shellfish bastard. I mean, that smells good to all of you.

The secret behind these is wash them under cold running water, gets rid of the sort of grain, sometimes a bit sand, little bit clay in there.

        "text_captions": "[music] Right, Come on, let's be honest. Ramen is that comfort food that we all love. especially on a cold day. And if you're studying at university, but today, trust me, I'm going to show you how to elevate that notoriously cheap dish into something delicious. And guess what? Give me a V. That's right, Vegetarian, right? Come in, Oscar, Let me show you the ingredients. Uh, egg noodles? Uh, delicious, rehydrated liter in like three, three and a half minutes. Beautiful seaweed, scallions, tofu, ginger, and cauliflower. And these here. these are the secret ingredient. These are the dried shiitake mushrooms. They're gonna go into the water and they're gonna rehydrate now. Traditionally, you can start this with a chicken stock, a vegetable stock, or just plain water. Today we're going to start with plain water. I'm going to show you how to elevate this ramen, right? Let's have 10 minutes on the Clark so we can start off with boiling water. First of all, Season that water Okay, nicely. Now in the next pan, I've got a rolling water. We're gonna put our eggs in there, get them on a spoon, and drop them into that water. Okay, please time me six minutes. Justin, Bring it out to the ball. Don't ball them ferociously. They'll get that sort of black line around the outside, ball them gently, and I want to ball that, but a little bit of sort of yolky bit in the middle mushrooms into the water immediately. Okay in, and this is where it starts to sort of go up a level, turn the gas up. Okay, and now we're going to start creating that base. First off, a tablespoon of mixture paste in okay and give that a really good mix. Now those mushrooms are doubling in size. Okay, and the exciting thing now is that they're starting to give flavor to that water. From there, a nice tablespoon of soy? Okay, that's going to give some sort of richness to the broth. Okay, a little bit of acidity, a touch of mirin. Okay, that gives it a little bit of lift and a bit of a bite. And then one of my favorites: Tawarashi Spice Beautiful Japanese pepper In Now, bring that up to the boil, lightly, season it with the chili flakes, get your egg noodles in okay, and then from there, turn off the gas. Okay, that's right, turn off the gas now. give that a good mix. Taste that broth that's delicious, touch more salt okay for me, and then a little bit of salt. And look, the seaweed scissors. I just cut up some really nice strands of seaweed. Let's have to be very careful with the salt. in the beginning. I like nice long sort of almost strips like julienne. Okay, every minute, this broth is getting better, tastier and deeper. If I was going straight vegetarian, of course, I'll be using a vegetable stock. a chicken stock. It's delicious. That bee stock equally is delicious. But now open up those egg noodles okay and then just taste again. good. Now it's nearly there. Tofu Don't slice this too thinly okay, just literally into nice long, beautiful strands. lift it up and just place that on top. The secret now is that we're not going to be boiling that stock. but all those ingredients from the mirin to the miso are almost starting to sort of marinate. Oscar, Please pan down, have a quick look Now you can see. Look, it's almost like this smorgasbord of delicious ingredients. and man, that's good. That's so good. Take that off and let it sit there and simmer. I want to say simmer. I mean, put the lid back on. take your sesame oil and just gently hit the surface with that. But make sure the gas is off. I want a touch more spice in there for me. Just a touch. Let it simmer. The gas is off. Okay. Eggs are boiling time, please. Three minutes down, right? Three minutes down. Cauliflower. Open your palm flat, side down, and then grate. Now, this gives a bit of texture to the ramen. It's a great way of adding crunch to the top, especially with those eggs. And then from there, look, I'm almost sort of getting all the way down to the actual these bits here. Just cut round there okay, and just slice those bits nice and thin. And these stalks are so delicious. Okay, like the stalks on a broccoli. Open up that beautiful ramen and put those stalks in there. again. another layer of flavor. Now from there, take your cauliflower, put that into the bowl. okay, lightly season it salt and pepper, and then lightly dust that with some rice flour. Now that's going to give a little bit of crunch and texture to the cauliflower. So when we fry it, it's almost gonna be like this beautiful crispy fried cauliflower. I want some chili in there so I've got some heat okay, and then look a touch more rice flour that helps to give it a coating and it's almost like a sort of a nice little shallow fly hot pan. Get the oil in and then watch. I want to sort of get that really nice crispy texture that sits on top of those noodles. It's a shallow fry. Okay, in there, halfway five minutes down. Now get that all up to temp. touch more salt in there whilst that oil is waiting. No, it's gonna be there. Check it first, and then look. just literally sprinkle that in there and look, what's happening to my cauliflower. It's getting really nice and crispy. Now again, I love frying in a non-stick pan because I get that texture and I really get it nice and crispy. I'm not using that much oil. Okay, it's a light shallow fry, but look, look at the color of that cauliflower. Beautiful. Now it's going golden brown and that's the texture that I want on top of this delicious ramen. It's amazing. Just a simple vegetable like cauliflower can enhance a beautiful ramen. From there, take a little slice of kitchen towel, get that ready, and then look. It's like it's really nice and crispy. I've got a bit of chili in there as well. Rice flour starts to coat the cauliflower. It almost protects it and gives it this sort of jacket that allows it to get nice and crispy. Time, please. Three minutes, right? Seven minutes in and look. Drain that off and you can see that beautiful, crispy, incredible cauliflower there that's so good. So good. Another season. Beautiful. Now, how do we build up those layers? Okay, I've got some wonderful spring onions and I like to slice them a little bit thicker and longer on the bias, so I go sideways this time. Okay, I'm saving the nice sort of tops for the garnish and the sort of white parts. Again, I'm just gonna sprinkle in over that. Oh man, that is just like a beautiful fragrant smell. So tops go on top. I've got my ginger sitting alongside. I've got my seaweed inside and the tofu now is sort of taking on that stock. One more final taste and look at it in there. Oscar. Come in. Come in. Pan down. Pan down, Pan down please. That is so delicious. Oh man. now eggs. take them out. I always like to sort of put them into cold water first before I start peeling them and look a little trick. Just get the base, crack it and set it in water. Crack it, blow and sit in water and I'll show you why in a minute. Right time to serve. Get your bowl. This is a very generous sort of family style dish. Okay, big, deep, beautiful dish. Now look at that noodles in first. The flavor from that stock in that short period of time is extraordinary. 90 seconds. Man, we're up against it. Look, take that out. The smell is incredible. Beautiful from there. My sort of pickled ginger, my scallions, spring onions and then look. it's beautiful. Nice crispy cauliflower on top. Amazing cauliflower. Now with the eggs. Time please. 50 seconds, 50 seconds. So tap, tap, tap, pull, pull, pull and then just put in your top of your hand and blow and that from there literally should come off super quick. And it is. and then literally dip it back in the water. Any excess shell and it should be slightly should be slightly run running the middle. Oh man. runny yolky and then look just from there, just literally snip snip snip snip some fresh cilantro coriander. Doesn't matter what country you're in, it's all delicious. And there we are. a beautiful ramen in 10. to all of you, thank you for watching Ramsey Intent. If I went too quick, I apologize, but slow it down.

A simple vegetable like cauliflower can enhance a beautiful ramen. Rice flour starts to coat the cauliflower and gives it this sort of jacket that allows it to get nice and crispy. I've got my ginger sitting alongside seaweed inside and the tofu now is sort of taking on that stock.",

        "text_captions": "[music] right? Um, ever thought we could do with leftover croissants? Well, trust me, I have the perfect breakfast, brunch, or even sweet treat recipe that is definitely a crowd pleaser. A delicious croissant. French Toast in literally 10 minutes, right? Oscar. Pan down please Young man Croissants. They're 24 hours old. Okay, a little bit firmer. Nothing wrong with that. Uh, beautiful apples. A little bit of custard left over eggs, demoral sugar, butter, touch of tartness, creme fresh, a little bit of honey, cinnamon, and some powdered sugar. right? Let's get 10 minutes on the plot for this delicious sweet treats now. Hands on. Don't get them too hot, but get them hot enough. Okay on. I like to use frying pans non-stick preferably First things first: get your batter ready. Eggs in Okay, and I want this sort of quite thick. I like it to be somewhat a really nice way of coating a quest on. So whisk up the eggs. a little touch of milk in there, just a tiny drop, okay, and then literally whisk that up. Now here's where the magic starts. Take the quest on and just put your knife in there and twist with a point. You know, inside those croissants? When you slice inside these, there's lots of holes, right? And that's because of the sort of yeast, the way the layers work in a croissant. Put your knife in, get your custard into a squeezy bottle, put the nozzle in and squeeze, and basically all we're doing is turning left, turning right, and filling up that croissant. Now, as it starts to fill up, you feel the weight of this croissant, get a little bit heavier in and it comes and seeps up through the top. Again, In down, squeeze, turn left, turn right, come back up to the middle, and literally count to three and pull out okay touch more. Boom! Got this nice weighted custard lined croissant. Now so far so good. Pan, nice and hot. We move quickly on these things. You have to be super careful that you don't overdo it. Get your apples okay. and this is just a very simple, delicious way of serving a sort of lazy brunch lunch. I like the sort of apple chunks I don't like. cut them too small. I like them sort of a little bit robust. Also, the flavor of these Granny Smith are beautiful. Sometimes you can make the apples the day before, so they sort of stew overnight in the fridge. Delicious. Now what I'm trying to do here is make a very sort of quick toffee apple. Okay, in, we're gonna run two pans at the same time. Apples go in to the little pan, whack up that gas. After that, I'm gonna sprinkle my brown sugar and form a really nice caramel on there. Okay, now let that caramelize. Be very careful because it gets very, very hot. The secret of a great caramel is the butter. Okay, butter goes in. Apples are getting caramelized, but I'd like just a little touch of cinnamon in there. Okay, that's going to make that sort of a little bit more spicier. Cinnamon in now. Mix that up a little touch of salt. a salted caramel. beautifully done butter. and look. We got toffee apples now and that cinnamon smells incredible. Give that a nice mix. be careful when you flip it once that sugar dissolves. This is how you turn it into something toffee. Get a nice spoon. A creme fraiche goes in and that creates this really nice tartness to that caramel. Bring that back up to the boil, turn that down, and let that cran fresh melt. And also, you've got these beautiful, nice light glazed toffee apples right now for that incredible French toast croissant in and sort of push it down and manipulate it in now time, please thank you Right touch of olive oil there? Just a smidgen, okay. a little bit of butter in there. Just a touch that stops the butter from burning in, roll and on in. Push it down, let it absorb that amazing egg. Don't squash it too much, otherwise the custard will come out in and there you go. Beautiful. Now, lightly see that custard on top. My apples are sat there. I can make them a little bit more delicious just with a little spoon of wild honey in there And that gives another added sweetness. But look at that Beautiful. now. Gas back up first. One turn over. Beautiful. Beautiful. and it's almost like a sort of, uh, quick, sort of, fast track take on an eggy bread. Except we've got the sweetness of the custard on the side, that beautiful egg, and then look, oh my goodness me, that's so beautiful. There we go that can sit now in the caramel, the flavor that is delicious. Now once you've got the color on the croissants, turn them on the side and cook on the side as well. You want that custard stain in the middle time, please? [music] Get it. nice and crispy. That's the secret behind eggy bread. Isn't it? Getting it all nice and crispy? I've got enough heat in the pan, literally 90 seconds each side up and out. that one sits there, that one rolls over. Don't forget, we still got the magic of the custard in there, and that sits there. Now the apples. Take the apples. I said to this, almost like a sort of a glazed spicy toffee apple. And then when you cut into that croissant, you've got that wonderful custard. and then look, I'll just drizzle some of that toffee. It's too good. Do not throw that away. And then finally, I like to mix the cinnamon in with the powdered sugar. And then we just tap tap tap. And literally, I should rename this book Brunch in eight minutes because there we have a beautiful fast track take on eggy bread with toffee apples. to all of you. Thank you for watching Ramsey intent If I went too quick, I apologize, but slow it down. Now Don't forget to pick up Ramsay Intent cookbook inspired by this series and trust me, you're gonna come out a much better chef.

        "text_captions": "[music] right? Listen up. I've got four letters to describe this next dish. O M F G. That could mean only one thing. A delicious steak sandwich packed with flavor. Two slices of bread, and trust me, this dish will not make you the idiot sandwich in your household, right? Oscar. Pan down please. Babette Steak or Anglet as they say on false the chef's cut and it is super delicious. Really cheap. It is the perfect steak for a sandwich. Beautiful big flat cap mushrooms, onions, a beautiful Coltan battered blue cheese, lettuce, and a little bit of peppery watercress mustard, Tabasco, lean pearing mustard, And a beautiful loaf of bread. right? let's have 10 minutes on the clock, please. Now, first thing, you want to slice this big slipper into half. Okay, now I like using the chapata bread. I like to sort of douse it in some extra Virgin Olive oil. I like to season it nicely inside, but watch salt pepper generously. Okay, a touch of chili flake on there generously and then look, get that on the grill. Okay, now get something heavy a plate on there and just push that down. That's going to get you a really nice, crisp, beautiful, amazing color on there. Now, the steak usually season it okay. really important because sometimes you think there's a lot of salt to the naked eye. But it's not because we lose 30 of it the minute it hits the grill. Get that out of the fridge at least three or four minutes before you're going to cook it. It's got very little fat, but it is quite fibrous. Okay, so you need to be super careful of not overcooking it. The secret of a good steak like that is letting it rest. Okay, let's just check our bread. I want a really nice color on there and open that up. That's what I want. And those chilies are doing their magic. Push it down. Okay. the bread will bounce back up. but get those marks on that bread. It will make a huge difference. Now off goes one. Okay, Beautiful. Off goes the second one. Now we go on with our steak. Okay, let's get the hottest part on again. Roll it around that marinade and get it on there. So bread's working. Steak is cooking. don't keep on flipping the steak. Leave it on there. Okay, now let's start thinking about the garnish. I love these big flat cap mushrooms. I love them. Take off the stalks, mush them on. Okay, they'll break down. They'll start cooking literally in seconds. A nice season on those mushrooms. Okay, think of the way we're laying this up. Okay, I've got my steak. I've got my mushrooms onions this time. Go about a centimeter thick and start slicing some beautiful onion rings. But don't worry about opening them up, just get them on there. Okay, and start grill them. Hold like that. they'll break up. but again, from there, a little touch of seasoning. Okay, now I want to talk to you about the sort of the sauce. How do we come together with this flavor? I've got some mustard, Tabasco, and Liam Perry. It's a wonderful combination. Turn that steak over. Look at that color. It's exactly what we want. Beautifully done mushrooms, turn them over, and then when it comes to the onions, a little bit smaller, a little bit fiddlier doesn't matter on there and on. and you can see those colors now from there. take your Worcester sauce a couple of tablespoons in there, first your tabasco first off, painted brush and just start glazing that steak. Okay, as we start to cook, the flavor and the smell in here is incredible. It's almost like a little varnish, okay, over the onions as well. Now all that flavor from the steak is coming out. It's running into the mushrooms, it's running into the onions and it is absolutely delicious. Now from there, take two nice teaspoons of mayonnaise in two nice teaspoons of mayonnaise, one nice teaspoon of Dijon mustard generously done, a tablespoon of Lemon Perrin and give that a really nice mix. This is our lining for the bread. Okay, little taste, a touch of spice, a little bit more. with the Tabasco. I like it quite sort of hot, so that's incredibly rich for the steak. Salt, pepper, and that's gonna be my dipping sauce. Okay, dipping sauce and sauce is gonna be on top of that bread time. please. Halfway now sauce goes in. Okay, look at that. Beautifully done. The secret behind making a great steak sandwich is getting organized. And this is how I get organized. I dress everything first. So first off, one spoon all the way down. Okay, start laying this beauty up. Now from there, open up my lettuce, snap the lettuce and slice that in half. Okay, snap it and slice it in half and then gonna dust that with my peppery watercress. Okay, and then from there, lightly season that in there really important salt and pepper. And then look, get your dipping sauce and just throw that over. Okay, now think of the layers we've got. Okay, so beautiful. Let that sit. it's all in the build-up and if you can build and cook at the same time, even better. Now Look, the mushrooms are coming down beautifully. The onions are caramelized, so once that steak is cooked okay, there's a nice surprise to this. and think of the combination Guinness mistakes like tomato and basil just flood that grill with a touch of Guinness and just let that Guinness literally absorb through those mushrooms through those onions and through that steak. And look, what I'm gonna do now is roll that steak over that Guinness and that caramelizes beautifully and the flavor of that is just incredible. Now look, the Guinness evaporates, the alcohol is burnt off, but the flavor is incredible. Off with the gas. Just leave that sitting there. Okay, now we're gonna start building this up. I take my onions off the grill and I dot them over that beautiful salad. The secret behind any great steak sandwich is in the build. Okay, look at that. My mushrooms come off and they sit on top. the smell of that Guinness. It's beautiful and then there. Now for the steak time. please. Two minutes. Now for the steak. Look at that. I'm going to slice this on the bias down. not too thin, not too thick and look color there. Once that's sliced, lift that up and then sit that on top and get that on there. I'm happy for it to sort of bleed and those juices to run through that steak sandwich. Next one off again on a bias. Again, that Guinness is delicious. The flavor is unreal. Sit that on top, be generous with that. Okay, you can't stick a whole steak in there, slice it and let it go. Now before we close that over season it lightly, touch the salt, touch the pepper, and then your dipping sauce. One more time over she goes beginning, smells delicious and then finally turn that round. Look at that and finally it's beautiful age still and sit that on if you can. get that on. Whilst the steak is nice and hot, it helps melt the cheese but sort of hide it okay. a little bit sort of mischief with it. stick it underneath, stick it on the side, and just sort of sit. It crumble it on top of that hot stake and that's going to lift that to another level and then say goodbye because you stick that on top of there. You get your knife, you slice that bad boy and trust me, you open that up, take a bite and you're ready to die. And there you go. A delicious steak and Guinness sandwich to all of you.

The secret behind making a great steak is getting a great sandwich organized behind the scenes. The perfect steak for a sandwich. Beautiful big flat cap mushrooms, onions, a beautiful Coltan battered blue cheese, lettuce, and a little bit of peppery watercress mustard. The secret behind any great steak sandwich is in the build-up, says Ramsay. The Guinness evaporates, the alcohol is burnt off, but the flavor is incredible. Now look at that and finally it's beautiful age still and sit that on if you can get that on. And there you go, a delicious steak and Guinness sandwich.",

Or as you well know to you and I Microwave Or as every chef in the country knows, Chef Mike Whatever you call it sometimes, I promise you it can be helpful on certain occasions. This is the Ramsey Classic. It is a beautiful sticky toffee pudding and I promise you it's done in 10 minutes with my amazing assistant who never answers back. Chef Mike Right? Oscar, Pan Down. Let me show you so. The big secret behind any stickers I'm putting are dates. We're gonna slice them up, mix them a little bit bicarb. That's gonna literally cause a bit of reaction. it'll start to puree those dates. Then I'm gonna make the cake mix with beautiful brown sugar, butter, flour, egg and this baby here golden syrup we all grew up with that so delicious. Then on to the sauce, finish with a nice tart creme. Fresh, right? Let's get 10 minutes on the Chef Mike, right? Power up to 100. Okay for 30 seconds? No, you're not going to believe me. This is actually going to be done in the microwave. It's a beautiful fast track sticky toffee pudding. Here we go. Dates. Now. come on, we all have a date. unless you're my assistant. Justin Mandel hasn't had one in four years, but these are soft, chewy, delicious, and more importantly, I'm hoping after this lockdown that he does have a date and she decides to stay with him. But now dates, slice them nice and thinly okay. Once they're sliced nice and thinly, just put them into a bowl. Okay, and then from there, literally a little teaspoon of bicarb. Okay, now this literally helps to break down the dates. Okay, a little touch of water in there, just a touch and that will start almost pureeing the dates. Chef Mike, are you ready here? We go right on Power 100 and let's go for 30 seconds and go. Now let's start the actual cake mix. Okay, let's get the butter in okay alongside the brown sugar. Now start to cream that okay. Best thing to do is get the back of the wooden spoon and just literally lightly beat that. And what happens now is that we start to sort of break down the butter and we form this really nice sort of batter. How long left? Eight minutes. now. from there, cream with the back of your spoon. Okay, literally. Sometimes I put my hand on the bottom of the bowl and the heat from my hands starts to melt the butter nicely and then look, mix that up nice. Once we start to cream, that in that butter starts to melt and the sugar starts to disintegrate in with a nice tablespoon of this beautiful syrup now in and over. Twist that around back up. don't spoil any beautiful. Now from there, use that spoon to clean that off okay and then literally start creaming that up. Now it may sound a little bit bizarre using Chef Mike, but trust me, every chef uses them and sometimes they're just great for reheating dishes. And as you know, a microwave cooked from the inside so you have to be very careful. Egg flat, surface, crack, lift up and beat that in. Now now you can start to see this batter sort of forming but use the spatula, clean the spoon and clean the sides as you go along and then flip over. Now once you start using the spatula, we're incorporating a bit of air now and that's going to make the mixture a little lighter. Good time, please! Six minutes. Great. Now if it starts to separate, kind of a little whisk and just give that a really nice whisk and that will get your batter really nice and smooth. Okay and here we go. Chef Mike to the Redmi. Now once that's nice and smooth, it should look a little granular like that. Nothing wrong with that. from there. get your dates. Okay and look, they've broken down a touch. Okay, they've gone. literally. almost like a nice cure back in there for another 30 seconds. Here we go and that starts to break those dates down. Now butter, sugar, syrup are in okay and then from there give it a really good whisk. They're nice and smooth and now look just on. Now from there dates out you can see what's happened there. Look at this nice beautiful date puree. In goes the days. Beautiful in goes the flour. Okay, we're gonna sift that in there. make sure there's no additional lumps and this is where it goes up a notch. Okay, normally we'd be steaming these and baking them in the oven with paper on top and sort of steaming them for 45-50 minutes. It's a really nice fast track way. now. whisk comes out. give that whisk a nice shake, and then just a couple of turns the whisk comes out. Get the spatula in there. We get that nice even distribution of that flour through that mix. So now it's looking like a really nice, delicious batter, right bowl? Make sure it's nice and dry, Brush generously with your butter okay, and then just lightly vertically. put those strokes up that will help the sticky toffee pudding coming out and it is just a light smidging of butter from there, almost like a sort of half a tablespoon of flour. Shake that around and then just line that mould and all that does it stops it from sticking once you've gone all the way around. Back in, and then look, get your mixture and fill it two thirds full and now this is where the magic starts. Back on. Two thirds full Just in there. Now give that a gentle tap that let's mix it all the way around the bottom and now take some kitchen roll okay and just sit that on top. I want to go sort of 30 seconds times four into Chef Mike. The paper helps it steam to begin with, then halfway through it will take The paper off. Chef Mike, Work your magic myself. Work your magic in. Now. set that to 30 seconds, 30 second increments, right? Chef Mike, Work your magic right. Pan on. Now for the beautiful Campbell Sauce. So that paper helps to steam the top and it should be about two and a half to three minutes in Chef Mike's oven. First in goes your butter. Okay, now I'm gonna make this beautiful caramel sauce. Melt. That butter sugar goes in. And now we're going to start a camel. 30 more seconds. There we go. now. Melt. Melt your sugar. So for the beautiful sauce, I've got brown sugar butter in there, I've got some double cream. And then to finish the top, I'm going to put some creme fraiche on top of that pudding, Bring that to a boil, and add a tablespoon of that beautiful golden syrup. Chef Mike is working his magic time. Please Now stir that sugar. Let's check on Chef Mike. Now look where we are. Take that off and that is getting there. Okay, Beautiful. Now, Chef Mike does tend to be a little bit dirty. Okay, so like all good chefs work, nice and tidy. Look at that. It's started already. Take the paper off Back in Chef Mike. It's on overtime today now. Sauce: Look at that. melt the sugar, the butter syrup in, and then fold in your cream. That's going to make a beautiful, amazing caramel sauce. Melt that syrup. Chef Pike and then add your cream in there. Now cream goes in that stops the sugar from burning back onto the stove. and look at that. It's got this beautiful, aerated toffee, beautiful syrupy sauce and mix that in off. I want that really nice, beautiful, syrupy, lovely toffee sauce. Time please. How long? One minute? Come on man. Come on Chef Mike Monty right? Um, that smells good. That smells really good. Get a little knife and just go around the outside and then on one two three, drop you ready. Oh yeah, Beauty. And then you get your sauce and you just coat that and hit it on top so it sort of falls over. We call it nape and it's just like this perfect, beautiful mound of sticky toffee pudding. And then look, you got your creme fraiche, your sticky toffee pudding. And just to be ultra chefy, get some toffee on that creme fraiche and there you go. a beautiful sticky top of pudding in 10 minutes. Thanks to Chef Mike to all of you, Thank you for watching Ramsay intend. If I went too quick, I apologize, but slow it down.

Make sure it's nice and dry, brush generously with your butter and then just lightly vertically. put those strokes up that will help the sticky toffee pudding coming out and it is just a light smidging of butter from there, almost like a sort of half a tablespoon of flour.",

        "text_captions": "[music] Right, Come on, let's be honest. pork is such a versatile and delicious protein and with just some very small steps, trust me, you can elevate that dish to a culinary masterpiece, even in 10 minutes, right? Oscar Pandan? Let me show you the ingredients. Pork Tenderloin: The nice thing about this part of the pork? It's almost like the pork fillet. Okay, very very lean, incredibly healthy, but more importantly, cooks within like three or four minutes. Beautiful slices of prosciutto, beautiful fresh corn, red onions. We're going to do a nice sort of. It's almost like a corn roasted salsa. Beautiful herloom cherry tomatoes, a little touch of chili oil, fresh spinach, fresh basil, touch of butter, and this is my secret ingredient. It's a little bit of garlic powder that absolutely elevates pork to a whole new level, right? Let's have 10 minutes on the clock. Pan on the salsa needs to have texture. It needs to get a little bit of sort of char. Best way? Literally, try and keep it whole. Okay, keep your kernels down and just sort of be quite vigorous. and don't worry about slicing them off into tiny little particles, just literally hold the kernel up and then literally down. Now, scrape into that husk. Okay, what we're looking for is the ribs. How do I get that char to begin with? Lightly season the pan. Okay, throw that corn in there and get it toasting so it becomes salty, charred, and a little bit of flavor. As you know, there's no oil in there yet because I want to char it and that starts getting the outside bursting with flavor as that's taking place. I love using red onion in salsa top until the onion. Slice it in half and just nicely slice. Don't go too thin if it goes too thin, it actually starts to sort of overcook. Onions in charred again. Dry pan. Really important. Dry pan. You'll see why in a minute. That's where that flavor is going to come from next. Get your cherry tomatoes. Okay, and literally just slice these in half. I want to blister these. Okay, and the nice thing about these tomatoes? They're so soft, succulent, but incredibly juicy. Don't throw them in too early. Okay. bursting with flavor. They are so ripe it's beautiful. I like to just season those tomatoes before they go in there. That'll help them to sort of bleed, take out that incredible moisture and intensify the flavor. Now look at this. Pan down. Pan Down. Please. pan down, Oscar. Look. Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha. Okay, everything's getting nice and charred over there. A little hint of dried chili salsas need a lift? They need a bit of a oomph and a bit of sort of a you know, a sort of a kickback. And that dry chili in there goes beautifully well. Get your pork lightly, season it with salt and pepper. I like that coarse pepper pork. You know you gotta gotta give it color to get some flavor in there and then look dust it both sides with that beautiful garlic powder that makes the pork a little bit spicy. Again, dust dust, dust and you'll see When we come to saute this, it gets that really nice crisp flavor now again season, leave them almost lightly dredged in that. But now look at this char. Okay, it's now drying out and charring. It's bursting. Pan nice and hot with a tenderloin. This pork tenderloin. Okay, I promise you. you can finish pink. Okay, it doesn't need lots of cooking, it just needs a nice quick sear. and look. that spicy beautiful onion powder gives it exactly the nice color it deserves In start off at 12 o'clock all the way around and that nice caramelized pork is delicious. Get all that in there as well. in time, please. Wow. So three and a half minutes gone. Now don't turn that pork. Okay, Do Not turn that. Look twelve. One o'clock Two o'clock Three O'clock I want some color on that pork. Doesn't need messing around. Before I turn it. a small knob of butter. Okay, and she goes just around the outside in and look. My corn is actually popping now. But pan down Please Oscar. Look at the char on that. There's nothing in there. it's just charred beautifully. Really beautiful. Now spoon on and flick that pork over. The secret behind this pork is letting it rest. But look at the color on that. Pan down. Oscar Oscar. Pan down. Please. Pan down. Pan Down. Beautiful. Honestly, Oscar. but hate yourself Otherwise, I'll get Megan back. now. From there, we'll start that salsa moving. I've got that nice charred, beautiful flavor. Okay, in with a touch of oil. Now you can hear it coming alive. Look, she's letting you know. In with a touch of chili oil. Now it's coming alive now. I put my tomatoes in time. Please. Halfway off, snap, crackle and pop. Look at the color on that. Beautiful. Really beautiful. Now pork is going to take literally 45 seconds each side and it's a filet. Okay, so treat it like you're cooking a filler steak out and then literally onto the plate and get that draining. okay, really important out and drain that garlic. Smells delicious. Pan back on the heat, give that a little wipe. Wipe it out. now. look at this with a salsa. turn that gas off. Okay, that smell is delicious. I'm gonna fold in some of my spinach. my fresh basil. Okay, get that pan nice and hot and then look delays the salsa. for the touch of vinegar, it's gonna bring it all together beautifully. And now on top of that with the olive oil and all of a sudden, we've got this nice beautiful layer. But look at that. the spinach is melting throughout. The char on that corn is just incredible. and look, let it sit there. let it sit and almost marinate. Now Prosciutto time. please. Oil into the pan. I want a little bit of crispy texture to this pork. Okay in she goes. and these are so tasty, especially when they're nice and crispy. Lathe into the pan and then literally 15 seconds each side and look on. It's like sort of posh bacon. nice and crispy and it gives a lovely texture. And it's pork on pork but just with a different dimension. A little touch of kitchen roll that helps get it really nice and crispy and that's it. Look out over and the smell of that is incredible. Let me tell you, I mean, look at that beautiful onto the kitchen paper that gets it even crispier, drains off any excess fat, and look finally the big one. I like to give that a touch of seasoning as it starts to cool down. that salt sticks to it off with the pan and beautiful. The poshest bacon in town now time please. This is the exciting part. Look at that salsa. All you do is just place that in the center. Okay, it's marinating beautifully. It's popped in color. I'm gonna put a nice layer of that crispy prosciutto on there. I'm gonna get my pork and sit that just on top, literally. and then one more and then from there it's gonna drizzle a touch more of my salsa on top. And then literally. that corn smells delicious. A little touch of olive oil on the outside, a little touch of my chili oil just dab, almost like dabbing it time please. And then literally just kiss that with a touch ball on top and then finally look here. This oh boy, that is just music and these beautiful little bits around and that honestly has to be one of the most delicious pork tenderloins anywhere in the country in under 10 minutes.

But if you get them done in 10, 12, or 15, or 20, or even 30 minutes, I promise you it doesn't matter. This series will teach you the skills to make you cook more confidently at home. To all of you This is Ramsey and Ten Good Luck! [Music] right? Come on, let's be honest, everybody is turning green. But have you done it with pasta full of vegetables cooked in 10 minutes? I bet you haven't but after this, you definitely will. So this dish is delicious, full of flavor, and trust me, any member of your family is gonna love this dish, right? Uh, Oscar Pandan. Let me show the ingredients. so obviously Fusilli. Now if you haven't got fusion, you can go with penne or even spaghetti. Beautiful fresh kale, lime, lemon, garlic, arugula, almonds, parmesan, and this little whizzer. It's a beautiful nutribullet that's going to blend that beautiful green sauce. Then we're going to finish that and run it through the pasta and then top that with some almonds. right? Let's get 10 minutes on the clock. First off, season that past the water. Okay, get the gas on there and be germs. The olive oil. Okay, this olive oil sort of helps emulsify the sauce. Now Garlic: Okay, I said earlier. you can use a little chilli. Okay, don't sweat about chopping the garlic super fine. The finer the garlic, the quicker it burns. Okay, so just lightly slice that garlic and you know what from there in, get that gas up and then again, literally start frying that garlic off there. now. lightly seasoning. Okay, I'm gonna put a little touch of heat in mine, just a touch of chili flakes in there. Okay, once you start getting a bit of color on that garlic, okay, I'm gonna add my kale. Now the kale's gonna be sort of lightly sauteed, and then we're gonna steam it. At the end, I'll show you why, get that in there, and literally cover the base of the pan with that kale. Now from there, you'll see this almost sort of wilt down, but not as fast as spinach, and kale's got that nice sort of rugged texture running through, so it's got some sort of it's got some energy to it. Spinach disappears. Kale. cooked beautifully. A little touch of salt on top, salt on bottom, a little touch of pepper, olive oil drizzled on top. Okay, I'm gonna throw in a couple of the almonds just now to get a little bit toasty and make that sort of come together as a flavor. Pasta turn up the heat. I like to cook the pasta quick. This is fusilli. Fresh pasta is going to cook literally in about three minutes. Okay, get a nice gentle rolling boil and roll that pasta in there. Bring up the temperature super quick. put the lid back on. I always like just to turn the pan that stops any pasta underneath literally sticking to the pot. Oscar Pan down please. I just want to look at this in here. The kale is starting to wilt down. Okay from there. get yourself a ladle and then take some of the pasta water which is full of starch and just go round in there. That's the noise you want to hear. Time please. [music] Two and a half minutes down, nobody goes down right from there. Sweat that off, turn the gas, get that heat back in there and then look, you see that kale starting to break down. Now I want to get a little bit of sort of zest going on. a little bit excitement to that green kale. So look in with my zest and that starts to sort of make the kale a little bit more vibrant. Now look what's happening. Okay, the kale's starting to sweat and break down past the water's giving it that really nice touch of starch. a little bit of texture on top of that color of anchovies. Again, optional, but you need two or three nice salted anchovies. Chop them up okay, and literally just lift that up and throw them on top of the cow. Now give that a really nice stir as that kale starts to cook. Okay smell with that citrus at the end. just sort of lifts this. I don't want to overcook the cow. Okay, I want some structure in there from there. Get your beautiful mix, collect all your kale sort of one side and fill up that beautiful little blender. Now you can use a blender. or you can actually use a stick mix as well. This thing just does it beautifully and quick. Now from there, look, get that juice and literally just pour that inside. Can't throw that away. The flavor in there. It's crazy now. look time please. Four minutes coming up to halfway. Give that pasta a little shake. Now before I whiz that look. A little touch of olive oil. Okay, a little touch of seasoning and then lid on. Now I'm going to break this down gently. Okay, I don't want to go too puree so it's just literally on five seconds. Got this beautiful, amazing sauce? Now look at that. put that back into the pan. Now we start focusing on the seasoning, spread that out, and look what's happened. It's broken down and like I said, you can put that in a blender or even a stick mix. But now we start to correct the actual flavor, halfway, touch more olive oil in. I'm gonna check my pasta and look, bring that sauce down to sort of, almost a sort of, almost like a nice creamy, richy density sort of texture. That pasta's beautiful out. Don't over drain the pasta starch inside. that fusilli really helps thicken the sauce and now you bring the whole thing to boil. Okay, and this is where it starts to sort of almost come alive. Beautiful. Come there. I'm going to start mixing that in and now you can see that nice fresh, vibrant green flavor. It's a perfect dish for us at weekends, especially after a run or an hour in the gym, a couple of hours on the bike. This is something that is hearty, incredibly healthy, but more importantly, so good. Now we use the kale. We've cooked the kale down. Sometimes I like to finish it with a bit of rocket as well inside the pasta. I'll show you that now. That gives that nice little peppery flavor. it goes all out now. give that a little mix and now you can see this whole dish coming together beautifully. Now from there, turn the gas down and again. I'm gonna finish that literally with some fresh lemon. Okay, I'm gonna add half of my rocket in, fold that in, literally, and then with the other half, I'm gonna dress that, turn that in. That's beautiful. Seven minutes in three minutes to go. Now that is beautiful. Off with a gas. Okay, give that a little shake. The remainder of my fresh rocket. A touch of salt, olive oil, a touch of lemon juice. I'm just going to glaze that lightly and just sort of dot that around. So I've got half rocket cooked and then that nice sort of texture of my almonds crunched through the hands in and then finally a nice salty, beautiful aged Parmesan and go over the top. And there you have, Literally a beautiful, fresh, vibrant, green, healthy pasta dish done in under 10. Boom Time please! you have one minute and 51 seconds remaining. I may be getting old, but let's be honest, I'm getting faster. Bon appetit to all of you! Thank you for watching Ramsay Intent. If I went too quick I apologize, but slow it down.

This week's episode will be hosted by Oscar Pandan, chef Ramsay Ramsay. Ramsay: \"Any member of your family is gonna love this dish, right? Let me show the ingredients.\" This is a perfect dish for us at weekends, especially after a run or an hour in the gym, a couple of hours on the bike. This is something that is hearty, incredibly healthy, but more importantly, so good. Now we use the kale. We've cooked the kale down. Sometimes I like to finish it with a bit of rocket as well inside the pasta.",

Uh, Happy Bank Holiday weekend? Uh what an amazing day it's been out there. Um, first of all, I just want to say uh, thank you to all of you in your thousands tuning in and coming up with these incredible recipes. Um, I've got the Magnificent Three back with me today for 10 minutes only to get this amazing video done. Um, let me introduce you to the crew. First, the dop Director Photography. There she is. Hello! You always do this. What do you want me to say? How are you doing? How are you doing? How was your weekend? How was your weekend? Repeat after me. I had the easiest A-levels in the history of school. I have not. I still have to do a little work just not the exams. But you you've got your own level on your marks. I haven't got my A-level yet. You got something that I haven't got. Um, how are you? How's your day up for breakfast? Anything else? Oh my goodness, Me Holly, What is that? This is? truffle truffles? Um, holes? Like we need another dog. That's our seventh dog, mine, not yours. Dog number seven. So we have seven dogs. We have three cats. Daddy's lost your dap. Obviously Seven dogs, Three cats, four parrots, five goldfish. And in fact they were called Jaws one, two, three, and four and five. Unfortunately lost two because I was starving for some two weeks ago. Where's my sous chef? Where is he? Where is he there? He is. He's Oh no. he needs a haircut. He needs a haircut. Uh, that's not too bad there is. It's got the old sort of the locks Down locks. the lockdown locks. It was pretty cool, right? Seriously. I mean, this house is exactly babysitter. Two meter distance with that shopping trolley, right? Let's go to bed. Uh, excuse me, it's going to be hey, good night, It's it's daytime troubles. Don't you dare poop on the carpet man. Just very quickly. Why do you call them troubles? Because I like truffles And his skin color is rare. Gotcha? Is that chocolate truffles? Or elbow truffles? White chocolate, white chocolate? right? Okay, Okay, okay. okay up here, right? You're not allowed to tell me what to do with the camera. You stick to the cooking. Okay, but if I say pan down, it means pan down. Please. If I say pan down and just pan down because you're missing the shop, right? First of all, come on. Seriously. Congratulations Sir Tom. I mean, how cool is that? I mean honestly, next week, no doubt he'll be auditioning for the new Bond movie. Incredible. What an amazing legend! Raised over 40 million pounds just by starting to walk in the back garden. That's an inspiration for everybody. The Nhs. Uh. incredible. I mean, what an amazing job again. So thank you to all of you! Happy Birthday Weekend! Happy Memorial Weekend in the Us And a big thanks to all of everyone across that country that sort of put their lives forward to get everybody safe. So what an amazing weekend. Ready Ten minutes, sausage and mash. Set the timer. First of all, turn your pants on, Get the gas on hands-on. Also, ball the kettle. Okay, if you bought the kettle, let the water boiling quickly. So when you cook the potatoes, it's done. Start the clock, please. Three, two, One. Excellent. Now Salt into the water. Okay, get that cup of boiling. Top it up with boiling water so you don't lose that boil. And obviously when you're up against it. Hand down, please. right? I'm gonna end this. Unless you stop. Get those potatoes in. Okay, and make sure that water's boiling. now. I've cut them super small. Okay, why have I cut them super small? Please. It's me now. But depending how much time you've got, take them down to the small, die small guys. They'll put literally in four. Five minutes. large, dies seven or eight minutes. But don't cut them too big, nicely salted water. and don't fill the pan up, just cover the potatoes with water. Next, sausages. I've got amazing pork sausage here. Okay, now a little touch of oil. Okay, I'm gonna start them off with a little touch of olive oil. Just a little touch. Okay, no it's not. It's not. it's the pan that's made. Start it in sort of semi lukewarm. Again, bring up the temperature. now. what are you laughing at ladies and gentlemen and then take a little cocktail stick okay and just sort of lightly tap them while you're laughing. Ladies, Now I'm just saying prick the sausage. Okay, and that stops the skins from bursting. Okay, now roll them around. Aromats. I'm talking about flavor. Get some garlic. Okay, from there, just crush the garlic. Put that in there. Now, the secret here is to get a really nice color on those sausages. I've got some garlic and some rosemary. now. look. okay. Roll them around. once you've got the color on those sausages. Okay, from there, turn them around. Let the pan do the work. Turn them around. I want these sausages. Nice and fragrant. Pan down. Please, turn down, get your pan on. Back up the gas as it starts to get color on there and put a bit of flush in there. Next your onion. For the onion gravy, I'm going to use red onion. Why? It's so much more sweeter, less acidic than the white onion, and it gets really nice and dark in terms of the caramelization. Slice the onion nice and fine. now. Tiny. drizzle olive oil in there. Take your onions and open them up into the pan. There you go. Look. now. flatten them out nicely. Okay time, please. Two minutes, two minutes. Thank you girls. You're all right today. Yeah, we are. A quick pan down some of the ingredients. Please look at this. I have some smoked salt here. Okay. Some Dijon mustard, vinegar, lemon, little touch of stock in there. Okay, look how quick my water's boiling already. Once the water starts boiling, come up and take a little bit out. Okay, and that way they'll cook even faster. Now, back to the sausages. Look at the color on those sausages. Now we go in with some butter. I've got a really nice flavor. Okay on those sausages. Oh, you're burning your onions. No, they're not. That's caramelized. Please don't start that again. please. That's not fair, right? Look, Pan down. please. I'm basting with the garlic and the rosemary and that butter is going to turn the sausage really nice and fluffy. Okay, Now look. if it splits, turn it around. It doesn't matter. Okay, and look what you're laughing at happening. Touch more butter in there. Okay, and then from there they're gonna go in to the other. Now time please. you have done three minutes, 40 seconds sausages in the oven. Literally about sort of 160 right? Pan down. Please. Look, look at these onions. First of all, flatten them in the pan like that. Okay, now watch very carefully. This is really important. Take a little teaspoon okay of sugar and just caramelize with the sugar in there. Put a little touch of salt over there. Okay, just a touch. Okay, from there, a little bit of butter and what's gonna happen? now with these onions. They get really nice and sweet and caramelized. But watch what happens when that sugar starts to caramelize. It's a sweet red onion, so it's incredible flavor. They cook instantly and they're nowhere near as acidic okay as the white onion. Now, I much prefer using red onion, and I do with shallots because the flavor is incredible. Now this is where the magic starts to happen. Gas is on full. Fast Food Vinegar. Pan down please. Balsamic Vinegar Just over. Now look at the color of the onions that intensifies the caramelization. Gives a little bit of acidity, but a really nice sweet way. Now, look at those onions. Pan down. Please. Pan down. I'm down good. Now This is where the magic comes in. Look a little bit. Worcester Sauce. Okay, again, just glaze over those onions. Now what happens here? It gives the onions a very dark note and it almost gives a sort of really nice sort of sour sort of rich flavor. Pan down. Please. Pan down. Pan down. Now it's gone. Yeah, halfway. basically. Thank you for the encouragement. Now look from there. Keep those onions flat in the pan. like that. They'll caramelize ten times quicker. But more importantly, the sugar, the lean paring, and the vinegar is making this wonderful caramel. Okay, now, look at the potatoes. Don't have been on for three minutes. Pan down. Please. come on. take that in. Take a little square out, put it between your fingers and push it and look. it's still a little bit firm in there, so that's about one minute away. Now, once you reduce the vinegar, reduce the limb carry, but just come into the pan again. Tilly, Come into the pan. See it from up here. They need to see it. I guess. need to see it. They can see it. Look at the color of that though. Look is that beautiful. Hello, I'm talking to you Tilly, I'm sorry. Yes, it's beautiful. Thank you. All you want is compliments. A little touch of stock. you can use: Vegeta chicken stock, beef stock. Don't flood the pan just about four tablespoons of stuff. Let that reduce down. Now bring that up to the boil. check the potatoes again again. I cut them into dice and look that's soft all the way through. Now here's the secret. The colander off. now. drain them, put your pan back on there. I'm not using butter in my mash. I'm going to use olive oil. Okay, give them a really good shake. Okay, dry out the pan. Please follow me on this one because it's really important. Okay, back in there, you'll say, why are you doing that? Why are you doing that? Thank you Because it's making them fluffy. Okay, that's really important. No, it's not. Listen, Okay, I'm just saying what you talk. I know, no. but I mean how many times I've made mashed potatoes for you? lots of times, right? Dad. Everyone's saying I'm doing a good job on the camera too. Stop telling me what to do. Okay, look, look in now. Look in please. So masha. okay, no ricer and in on the heat. Okay, now what happens now is the potatoes getting really nice and fluffy? Pan down. please. pan down down and then look. if you do this hot, we'll get them super fine. Again, Back off the heat. Now. Look. this is where they go up to another level. Look how fluffy they are. Look how fluffy that is. Down down, down, down, down, back onto the heat. Okay, really important. Now a little glug of olive oil and I want you to beat that in there now. Okay, and look. look what's happening. Come back down. please. got to come back down. So no butter, just olive oil in there. and eight minutes. Yes, okay, maybe two minutes. Look now. just look how rich, just look. Look, look at that. Beautiful. But I'm not done down with the gas. Some smoked salt in there, just a touch. a little bit of mustard in there. Okay, yeah, just a touch. And then from there, take the fresh chives that's going to give you a really nice lift and make this mashed potato so delicious. It absolutely lifts it. Go one minute. Yes, I've made mashed potatoes for you hundreds of times. Just look at that smoothness and look look that is beautiful. Come on. Pan in pan into my mash. Okay, off with the gas now. Just taste. Taste that okay. Take your time and tell what you think. Take your time. I am taking my time. Don't rush it. See dab. Yes, that's good. But white heat. Page 66: Marco Pierro White the Naked Chef Page 21: Jamie Oliver Delia Smith learned to cook Page 80. now all those books have one thing in common and those page numbers. The Best. Best mashed potato recipes out there. Dad. You only got 30 seconds left when you've gone. Really? Wait. Seriously, I'm telling you. Go look for those recipes and you will not regret it. That's unfair. Favorite match Ever. What you just did there. Come back down here this place. I've put a small knob of butter in there sausages. Check out Look Dad. 10 seconds to go. Okay, okay okay, but watch. I'm watching. Try and get a nice beautiful curve of mash. That mustard is so fragrant. Dad I hate to say this, but um, wait wait wait wait wait. In 10 minutes you're over. Wait wait look at that. Look at that. Come on please. I mean sausages. I'll give you a bit of extra time. Wait wait wait wait wait wait. Mommy didn't make it in 10 minutes On [Music] On Now I can't believe you just said those stats.

        "summary": " Thank you to all of you tuning in and coming up with these incredible recipes. I've got the Magnificent Three back with me today for 10 minutes only to get this amazing video done. I had the easiest A-levels in the history of school. I still have to do a little work just not the exams. I haven't got my A-level yet. For the onion gravy, I'm going to use red onion. It's so much more sweeter, less acidic than the white onion, and it gets really nice and dark in terms of the caramelization. The secret here is to get a really nice color on those sausages. I've got some garlic and some rosemary. I'm basting with the garlic and the rosemary. Jamie Oliver Delia Smith demonstrates how to make mashed potatoes. The Naked Chef's recipe is based on recipes from Marco Pierro White the Naked Chef. Jamie Oliver's recipe for the best mashed potato recipes is available on Amazon.com and PBS.com.co.uk.com. Done in 10 minutes and 57 seconds. Have a great weekend! Show me all your bangers and mash. God bless you! Have a good weekend! Share your photos with us on iReport.com/stunning mash.com.

The zest and the juice and that's gonna be secret. The chimichurri. But here's the difference. We're going to put the - chewy on the steak so the chimichurri absorbs inside at stake and it rests at the same time it comes off a rare. Well let's say off it literally means turn the gas off forever. Leave the steak on there first thing pans. night or not. Steak: I've taken out touch that tools.

We're going with some crushed garlic, red wine vinegar, extra virgin olive oil, and some honey. A lot of people are too mature. We put sugar I don't see sugar in that. The honey gives it really nice rich velvety texture. Take your potatoes and slice these people. Take their leftovers. They came nice and thin I Want crispy squid paper taters? you can do wedges my own. The most amazing state of Texas with a delicious fragrant chimichurri all the names of Megan James is programmed with 22nd birthday. The longer you marinate on top of that steak, the better, the longer the marinade is going to be absolutely incredible. The chef's go away now once we get to the right places.",

Everyone and having family work of NHS I know how hard you are working so thank you and God bless right? Rams in 10 I'm gonna make the most amazing color. My favorite curry is the butter chicken, but this is occurring with a twist because it's sort of. It's great for the kids and it's got butternut squash if you don't get Ponder's question there. Trust me, we can use courgettes or zucchini as we say in the U.s. it's simple, it's delicious and then why not let us know what you think I don't know. Direction today is the Matilda the sensation and peanut peanut. you stink. Tell us right? Okay, curry ingredients right? But are we ready? Stop the clock. Please thank you. Ten minutes? Yes, right? First off, hands off, I'm using a nonstick pan again. Told you I Bought this about four weeks ago from Tesco's I Think it's about eight. Ninety ninety five. Incredible. That's what little surprise at the end. I'll do something sort of pretty majestic. goes perfectly well with curry. You don't need me to show you how to cook. vice. Okay, so that you know what's happened over the last two months. you guys have turned into a national through this. This is how we do a quick curry midweek, especially the kids are here everywhere. Pan on, let's pan down, please tell you. but can you don't please Madam Red Onion But this question spilled: a small knob of ginger. a beautiful fresh chili chicken. Oh he's impressive. Okay, there's two breasts. This chicken dish is enough for six, but thighs are brilliant. If you want to use the drums, just keep the drums whole. but I'm taking the bone out off the top of the breast. After that, we've got some fresh frozen peas, coconut milk chopped Kenta Martyrs little bit chicken stock, curry powder, and little touch of olive oil. First off, forget the chopping for a moment. Okay, an illegal all chopped but box grater. Take the top off the purple that squash I just grate it okay now as you start grating, open up your hand I Need extra two minutes by the way because that was introduction. So again yes please. your top tonight chills start going please. Okay thank you yeah office is hungry okay from there. literally great now I Love II Would never think about putting a pumpkin inside the Korea but also for my beloved by churns out there, a pumpkin Corolla sown from the same way with vegetable stock is just as delicious. Now look from there from there and then just there. this is where you go slowly now. okay right from there look great. just test it. make with you. Okay now button? let's squat a little water I can't get the pan. Nice pot. and first off let me start cooking now. a little drizzle. Yes drizzle. Truly, you are wrong one today. use the pan and spread the pedlar squash throughout so make when you start grating these vegetables the sort of the yield. Okay, it's very very very sort of. you know, cost-effective from there right that guess up a touch of salt Carlos Please From there, lightly seasoned, get your curry powder. Okay now you can use a beautiful canvas. Allah This is just a beautiful color palette. fragrant and just likely to sprinkle that over a butternut squash. two and a half teaspoon. no camera salah. Beautiful, fragrant, delicious. You're not working there now. Okay, use the pan on the outside and start cooking all that. these will button a squash. Now the onion again hold it almost like a cricket ball in and just let you start grating again. and this sort of makes it a lot easier. I tell you why As it starts to cook, it's sort of pretty much disintegrates. And more importantly I use the red onion because of the sort of sweetness the less bitter than a white onion and honestly it's a sort of very mild flavor. tune is gone I know it's go in a hurry for tipping. You do have to push me. Okay, that's what my job here I've never seen an ungrateful Alright okay from there lift that up tap. Okay and they get that onion in there now. Beautiful on that family set up. A little bit of color on that Beautiful Let's watch. Now you can see why. We only need a touch of oil in there. and that's firm. that squash? great. It gives a really nice sort of rich texture to the curry. It's pretty incredible. Okay again, just a touch of sticky bit on top of the onions. And now get the chili. Okay, all I go to the season again. Roll nice and flat. This much spicy? Yes. But honestly, as the curry sort of cooks, you need that little bit of heat in there. Okay, fresh chili. Now the ginger. Okay. get that. Literally almost sweating off again to get the back of the spoon and spread it across the pan this way. it cooks so much quicker. Okay, and that we really chopped the chili. Look what's inside the pan. Get a little microplane, get the knob of ginger and grate that. Okay, again, hold it nice and firm. No rush. What? What happens now is that this sort of ginger disintegrates beautifully and it gets really nice and pureed. Pan down. Please move that pin down. See, look at that with all that beautiful juice. Okay and again, Gins debate Michaelis. Okay, incredibly fibrous. It's very very hard to sort of. you know to find ice. and then when you start dicing it on top of the board, the board's wet and all the flavor ginger has gone into the board. So I want the flavor of the ginger in the curry? So he grate it. Oh that's right from there. tap-tap-tap Keep your knife in there and just nifty great. All that down. Oh no. come back down please. Now look at that. The smell of that is incredible. Like I said I'm using curry powder. The nice thing about this dish. make your own spice mix. make your own garam masala. Beautiful. Sweating off like that, it's almost like a paste in there. Okay, and the good news is we've taken out the water. Okay now. creates a little sort of hole in the center from their disability spoon. all falling again and then get your chicken. Okay now chicken in. Okay, this is a breast of chicken. Something that cooks go quickly depending on the time. Bright cover, smaller or bigger. You want to do it in 20 minutes. A bit chunky I like them in a little slice. Taste on that aroma. Yeah mess. The chicken is silly. Now again, no, this is one of the most easiest, delicious curries you'll ever do. importantly as it sits in the fridge. what you don't use honestly, the next day is incredible now. okay. Peas in okay, peez, go in. That's gonna give a little bit of sort of texture and freshness with this curry. Now look at spinach. Okay baby spits, they go at the very very end. Let me do this. Vegetarians love then obviously No chicken. No stock preparation stock, lots of pumpkin, butternut squash, the zucchini and not the spinach is so good. Now look at that. Look, pin down, please. pan down. Tilly The chicken is still in there. Okay, now for some richness. Chopped tomatoes. go in, turn up the gas. After that, give them a little stir. you can see it started to come together from there. the coconut milk and that gives it a sort of sweetness. Also, it gives a little added richness. It's a really nice you're supposed to. Pender hands of the Hat Now pull that in, bring that up to the boil and this is where you start to think, wow, Do I need a touch more stock Again, just a couple of tablespoons of stock. You don't go. stop all asleep. Water is fine. bring that up to the boil and simmer gently. Now let that simmer it. Taste it. Don't crack the seasoning. Now what's the perfect economy? Okay, where the Poet no rocky breads? Okay. This is so simple that we said it. Rice clearly. Yes, of course. But Brent once a word you break. this is so super okay. I've got a hundred twenty grams of flour okay, a little pinch of salt, okay, a soon, blood of olive oil and about 120 grams of water. This is such a lovely accompaniment. Start rolling the water round, fold that in okay and all going to do now is get to sort of a nice soft dough texture panned out the curry. Please look at those flavors. Thank you. Listen, it's a curry in a hurry. Was delicious one go, you just pan down to the boat please I know no but this hopper is now little. Bring that back. Okay and all we gonna do is shake that into a little dough if you let that rest for about 15 minutes. Okay, what happens now it starts to relax I'm from there. it sort of forms this beautiful light bread dough. The rock salt gives it the most incredible flavor. Okay, but no. I beautiful board. Let that sit and relax. obviously. I made one earlier I've cut it into four. Okay, look from there all these beautiful billboards. Pat-down please across to the quarry. Yes yeah. busy busy now. quick. The seizing first that cooks well, look at texture. well touch up some delicious I'm not just saying you can't taste it I read you I promise you from there. okay when you're cooking, always ping down the side of the pan I know another way too much time that chickens will you cook I need to like flour your hands like hot pan on ok, nothing in there. ok, ok and then love with the bread. just literally roll these out. Okay now I quite like that. I'm sort of thin. okay and the more you let this relax okay, it better have become turn it over. Pull it along. Okay, get nice and thin. They gets really nice and toasty on the outside. fold it over like that and then go on to the next one. okay touch of flour I Know time to learn. Oh look two more minutes please look how down please and see what you let this dough relax. It's so easy to roll and it makes the most amazing bread. The curry. but I've got a little trip to it okay once it's nicely thing like that you can roll it back onto the roller okay, lightly. salt the pan okay, a splash of all in there okay and watch take that it's nice and thin piece the pan. she goes okay, like the gas that's in full. Look, watch that roast now. fine. back up to here please. The spinach just finished being rinsed okay, lay that spinach over okay and then get a spoon. What What happens? The Seville is almost sort of disintegrates, but gives it a really nice brightness to the curry and two tablespoons of cocoa powder, a fresh chili and literally in nine minutes you can see that chicken is what he cut if I was using the most amazing fine and let it cook a little bit longer. The spinach takes seconds to cook, but look at that inside or you can put chickpeas in there. I've got fresh peas and spinach. Pan down the bread Please over to the end and push away and flip. Push away and flip and then bang back down. Now that fresh bread there is beautifully crisp. I mean really crisp. The chicken got texture below. Honestly, it's so beautiful, so beautiful Now just the smoke. let that simmer when I get hold of that that. this bread literally takes 90 seconds each side and then beautiful spoons. okay I sort of build up the excitement with that. It's nice and thick and by literally okay grating that button there squash, put the texture and then from there fit your bread straight out of the pan.

I Love II would never think about putting a pumpkin inside the Korea but also for my beloved by churns out there, a pumpkin Corolla sown from the same way with vegetable stock is just as delicious. This is one of the most easy, delicious curries you'll ever do. Vegetarians love then obviously no chicken. No stock preparation stock, lots of pumpkin, butternut squash, the zucchini and not the spinach is so good. The Poet no rocky breads? This is so simple that we said it. Rice clearly. But Brent once a word you break. this is so super okay. The Seville is almost sort of disintegrates, but gives it a really nice brightness to the curry and two tablespoons of cocoa powder, a fresh chili and literally in nine minutes you can see that chicken is what he cut if I was using the most amazing fine and let it cook a little bit longer. The bread literally takes 90 seconds each side and then beautiful spoons.",

On day 40 of this tough, demanding, pressurized lockdown, the NHS workers have done an amazing job and also you know it's not just during the day as you know it's a 24-hour system. They have a look at the numbers that are decreasing and the amount of effort opening across the country is exemplary. Thank you so much it's now Colonel Tom Wall he's 103 days old. Actually he did get over 13 million and congratulations sir! I Hope you've got spoiled rotten and that fly by with those incredible aircraft was amazing. Now we're gonna do a Spaghetti Carbonara. Who will do something? Fingers crossed the first time this month. Forty days lockdown. Under 10 minutes Have fingers crossed. We have a new Director of Photography today. you may know how, but let me introduce you to go. Oh hello dude, he's got his new shoes on. Finally some new shoes and Oh somebody's as well. Oh oh no what happened you just spin around it. there's a nice cool jeans on Titus Look the skinny skinny man dude, you ready for some carbonara? Dude you ready doesn't couple now. Okay let's go I said I Promise Ten minutes now I know I've been sort of you know picking up or ask of a week but it's been a busy is it's gonna be sick on the day right till you set the clock. Here we go let's go Please Hustle it started. It's a start. They can't really stop paying attention and go rather come along until Italy Can you gues wearing it today? I Do that right? Hang on. Get your water boiling Lino start the clock. No no no cuz I don't know she started cooking it. This is the prep. Okay. season the water, get the lid back on. Okay. get the gas on non-stick pan. Okay, nothing in there. Get the gas on. We get that nice and hot. Okay now from there. pen down, up and down. Please put down. please pan down. I Know there's a few big speaking out that we should be putting garlic mushrooms inside the carbonara. but let me tell you something really important in Italy They do it with the quality of the cheek and there's no cream and there's a touch of regular garlic. but hey this is cool so give your construction love. Very cool. Oh come on sorry you gave us too. You know to come home so at least we give you is a mushroom and some jacked-up ice and peas as well. so pan down please. Fresh frozen garden peas. Beautiful bacon here. Okay, we've got some smoked streaky bacon, normal sweet bacon, touch of creme fraiche, egg yolks, and beautiful spaghetti. take between seven and nine minutes al dente. Come on mushrooms! I've got a little bit of chilli there Grana Padano for Parmesan, some garlic and it's such a chili to give it some heat. and I've never been a big fan of parsley, especially. they just dumped on the side of the play sandwich on that and finished at the end. I think makeup and I was always done with some amazing backpacked Matilda Stop right First things first. get your pastor in so I'ma do a double portion. So literally take a little curl like that. in and out. Okay, hold it nice and firm. open up, tilt down, keep up in. Okay, let it melt, don't break it I Just twist that around. Okay, twist that round but don't break it okay. one of those nice long strands. Okay, now from there and bring her up the ball. Now, like I said, the classic carbonara is telling the Niblick one. Charlie But we're going to go a little bit more sort of exciting and just cut these lines into the night rawness. Okay from there I mix it with a smoked bacon to give you that nice smoky bacon flavor. Okay, I'm not being clean in there I'll change your mind on the milk I'm gonna put a little bit of creme fraiche in there now. Wife: streaky bacon, you asked me. Okay, it's not the most amazing flavor, but more portly. It's got a lot of fat on there so you get that nice and crispy. okay smoked bacon cut into large sort of chunks, almost like big lumps and then just go through them. So about two inches long. Now wait, you see the difference when you use streaky bacon from that bacon? Okay, stop. which is a touch of olive oil? Just a touch. Okay, now that was born into the lid off and turn them around again and that stops the spaghetti from breaking up. Okay from that bake it in. Okay, now it starts looking rather large. Okay I like a lot of bases in my carbonara. Okay, nice, Nice. Okay I'm from base. you have to rewrite the crystals. These we're here to make sure on the bacon now. black pepper is okay. Why? I mean I that's what. Pete's go in there from there, take your garlic I Like leaving the garlic in, slice it nice and thin. Me: okay, would you actually keep them whole or serve it in silver? Let's go under for now please. Yeah okay. a little bit of sort of color on there, but the mushrooms give a little bit of fuzzy and more potently sometimes we just call it a bit of fakeness to Getty you sort of look for the ingredients but look in jail. Stop it. please. Now now from there, spit that out. no no. look at that run down. please come down in there or a lightly solve an hour. Okay, a touch of black pepper, have a touch of salt in there and this a secret for me. Just one beautiful red chilli I know you're gonna go clapping mad why there's something about having the most amazing this incredible color on the bacon. and then after that I was like the color on the mushrooms. Okay, but look at the city paper, it looks expensive Baker Now because all that fat John and that flavors in there. Okay from there everywhere it's okay. Oh, we're great from relevant other in size of the eggs now. I Said you use a little bit of milk. Any milk? What happens? The actual carbonara gets sort of very sticky Chloe Heavy and you want a little bit of texture in there. Some bread, some parmesan on top of the eggs and then look a nice spoon of creme fraiche. Of course milk is fine, but it just stops the whole mixture going dry. Really important. Hello my sisters, You have five minutes, Ten seconds. So halfway here we go. now. look at that. No, No, no please. Oh my goodness. Okay, look so you mix it up, the creme fraiche is really forming. Put a little water in there. Okay, the pasta water in there I Don't know what this portal could be it? Okay, excuse me who's in charge here. Hello Now from there look Doris from a liquid consistency that's really, really good, right? Let's check the class. Done. It's been five minutes. You do is tell no it's not cooked yet because it's still firm inside. it's not blending properly. Okay. Process down, please. - how beautiful is that? That's shitty? Okay. Mushrooms, Garlic chilli, streaky bacon. Smug quencher. Guess what there? Come on this is England Some fresh peanuts. A fresh frozen look at that also I Want a nice full Porto Carbonara Okay again. prep the single with a peas in there. lightly toasted. [Music] [Music] It's very important. Water this is. start creating a really nice base to wrap all that spaghetti around this ingredient. Okay, did we don't put the water in there. The eggs cook very very quickly and you have a problem. It comes gives your grainy so this is really important sign. Now from there. get up, get everything ready, chop your parsley, raising over, finish at the very end. How long left please? Um, you have three minutes left. Two days left. We've been fine. We're gonna climb. Parsi Gonna make it today. I Think we're mates today. Just chop the parsley once. Don't go too crazy right faster. we get the corner already down. gasping. Go on please. again. this is about 30 seconds away. Go against the scene it oh is it though. And if your fingers go through that gently. okay, It literally signifies it's done Okay, so look just that. it should just break off. Yes, that sticks on the scene is done. [Applause] When given this problem, please hand answers right. Time to dress the custom done as you can see it sticking to the ceiling. One more test I Think you need 10 more seconds? Hello. We gotta figure please. Yeah, Okay, okay. call is over drain. just a touch. Season the pasta again. there for watch. This is the most complicated part now. get your spaghetti. I Just be getting into the mix. Cut down, cut down please. No mixed up. first. this is where it gets tricky. eggs in. Turn the gas down. Now we have to cook this out Nice? Yeah, okay. nice twist. Let's forget it. Twist it round garnish I Never have time for fresh Parmesan. Hello Hello Hello 20 seconds. Oh bloody brilliant. Now let me give this to the neighbors. I Said to stay close Love our neighbor How wait to see you next week. You.",

        "text_captions": "Right? Welcome to Remedy in 10! I'm going to show you how to cook the most amazing dish in 10 minutes. but honestly I don't mind if you're 1 or 2 minutes behind I Guarantee you the tips and the inside I Will show you it'll fast-track that food and who knows one day you may absolutely nail it on 10 minutes. Today's dish is a beautiful pan-seared sea Bass where they sort of Mediterranean light tomato, eggplant or aubergine olive chili sauce I've got some leftover Chris Brooks Who's gonna be on the bass is actually a start, but this thing is an easy dish to put together. The most important all you to do is get organized and so 90% of this battle is in the preparation. So for the fish which are already fileted, it's a beautiful little baby sea bass and we'll score it. Sear it that cooks in about 2 or 3 minutes. Eggplants, cherry tomatoes, garlic, a little bit of oregano and these little calibration south and it's league. Chili's what's the longest thing to cook. That's what you could ask yourself. it's not the fish is the eggplant. Get the pan nice and hot first and guarantee this will be done in under 10. Here we go. So literally top and tail and with eggplant, you know it's a delicious vegetable. The less time you have, the thinner you slice it, there's no fast track. That's why I Love using these little ones and they're less bitter than the big ones, but more importantly, once they're crispy they are so delicious. Olive oil in get that nice and hot if that. all of all isn't hot, then the eggplant actually starts to go soggy and then they go greasy. Everyone worries about salting them and then squeezing know when they're this small. The eggplants do not need salting ok into the pan and get a really nice sort of crisp texture on those now eggplants in. The nice thing about this particular source, the source can be made and literally it can sit in the fridge for a day. The longer it sits in the fridge, the taster is eggplants in. You'll see that oil get absorbed straight away and that's why is going to be hot. So you get nice and crispy. If the pan is cold and the oil is cold, the eggplant will turn greasy and soggy. so get it nice and hot. You'll see them get beautifully colored from there. Start slicing your shallots and this is the base of the sauce now so we don't need to find ice. Anything is a sort of rustic Mediterranean Take on a beautiful roasted sort of sea bass. I Saw this dish down in a little restaurant just outside. San Tropez and this is sort of a faster version of it. Now you can see the eggplant getting nice and crispy and put a touch more all in there now and get some color on there. Really really important. Beautiful taste, not bitter at all and that's why I Much prefer using these small eggplant than the big ones. the big ones. takes so much more time to cook. Onions ready next to that clove of garlic as well. If you don't wanna slice the garlic, get a microplane and grate the garlic. I Like the texture of the garlic, so slice it again nice and thin again and then from there get your fish and just lightly score the fish. Just a nice little nick into the skin and that will stop the fish from coming up and again. Two or three little slices down shots. Garlic and Tomatoes ready. Tomatoes: A beautiful little cherry tomatoes from the vine. They're so sweet they're gonna go into the sauce or the very last minute. Now that's it. And now we're gonna start cooking them. Eggplants: Deeply colored and always once you've cooked eggplant, the most important thing is to take them out of the pan after that and just lightly drain them. Okay I've seasoned them salt and pepper to get it a little bit more exciting. Some zest of lemon. Okay, zest a lemon so it gives it a nice sort of citrusy delicious flavor. Now look at that. there's a glass. a beautiful they come out now. they just sit there like crispy. They're beautifully cooked the same pan. start off with a touch of waddle and we're not gonna over color these shallots and garlic. Gonna go in. Sort of just lightly done Fish: I Don't need to put on that. takes literally two minutes to cook that fish. My pans getting nice and hot on the side. Sure, lots of garlic in give that a really nice little toss on this source. Looking sort of rustic, a little bit relaxed, not too intense. I've got these beautiful dry tomatoes in as well. sun-dried tomatoes in and they'll keep them hold and the chili going to cut that into little slices. it's been in the brine and so again it gives the sauce that little touch on heat and gives it the right amount of heat. Seeds in: If you start the scene, the use of swords coming together, but you got that color on the shallots and the garlic, turn down the gas really super low, plus more olive. all. cool that down and then from there we'll put a little touch of white wine. she asked the touch. a tablespoon of white wine in there Narvik So good. Reduce that white wine down and then from there we start building out the sauce. Okay, I've got a couple of tablespoons of vegetable stock, give it a bit of body, and then from there a couple of tablespoons of chopped tomatoes. Take that off the heat you see, there's a really nice tomato a Mediterranean sauce coming together, lots of cooked garlic cooked. check on the seasoning, the heats in there. and now I'm gonna drop my tomatoes in there literally without cooking it so they go nice and soft. And then finally, I've got my olives for saltiness and then a touch of fresh oregano not a chop this to put that over the source, just pick the leaves in so it becomes a little more fragrant. And like I said, this sauce can be made a day to three days in advance as it sits in the fridge. It's so tasty. You all got onions and garlic and tomatoes at home so it's a great way of using leftovers and really makes a nice refreshing sauce. tablespoon of olive oil on top and then finally take your lemon and is great Now from there fish into the pan, Tops of all get it nice and hot, lightly seasoned the fish and then literally into the pan down and this sea bass cooks like salmon. 90% of it skin side down that keeps it really nice and crisp. but these little Phillips literally take 90 seconds to two minutes to cook beautiful couscous. All I've done here, just walk, the push goes back up to temperature and the squeeze a nice touch of fresh lemon juice into it gives that nice vibrancy and it's a really nice delicious garnish. It goes so well with a Tsubasa. Beautiful! Yeah once you've got a color on the skin that sea bass turn that over very carefully. We turn fish once. get the fish slice underneath horizontally so you don't break the fish up and over up and over. look how quick that cooked and then as that's cooking and I've put a little touch of lemon juice inside the fish which seizes it. Usually not lemon juice in that finishes cooking, that lemon juice goes inside. Now to plate, keep it simple. this is Dinner in 10 Luncheon 10:00 Brunch in 10. Nothing complicated. couscous in the middle, fish is still cooking nicely. I've turned the gas off and it's actually continue to cook from that heat. The sauce: I Just lift up those tomatoes I'm not stirring, not pressing. You can see the olives, the garlic. The Onion's the sun-dried tomatoes, all sort of melted into one but makes a delicious sauce and then look just drizzle around and then finally the fish. Take the fish out one to these beautiful crispy aubergine sits around the outside and it's such a lovely way of using baby eggplants. and then finally you ask the touch of olive oil around the outside and there you go. The most amazing sea bass with a stunning Mediterranean sauce. That's not dinner in 10th, that's dinner in 9 minutes and 40 seconds. Beautiful!

Today's dish is a beautiful pan-seared sea Bass where they sort of Mediterranean light tomato, eggplant or aubergine olive chili sauce. The less time you have, the thinner you slice it, there's no fast track. That's why I Love using these little ones and they're less bitter than the big ones. Narvik shows how to make dinner in 10 minutes and 40 seconds using leftovers from leftovers. The Mediterranean sauce can be made a day to three days in advance as it sits in the fridge. Narvik says it's a great way to use leftovers and really makes a nice refreshing sauce.",

A care of them for large large waxy potatoes. peeled and I'm gonna go a little bit dry because I'll get these things crispy. Will not find these potatoes in ten minutes. We're not going to spend 15. it's one of five them three times. They're going to take about three minutes to make the most amazing potato depending on the time depends on the thickness. You ladies ready Dad if only you could cook is called as fast as you speak Calvin I'm so sorry. Hey first of all, you're choosing unlike beetroot. Good news is you're out in time. You know for another three years if I got banned from Vegas Mercator Let's get this thing a little bit more flavor. Some teaspoon of baking. So it's a teaspoon. they'll aerate it up after that. I Want to flavor it? Start the clock. Please hold. thank you. A little bit of curry powder and I've put a little bit of curry powder in the seasonal plan as well. Just gonna dredge. Yeah. Actual beautiful Cod in there now. fear it's about 160 ml so just be under half a bottle. Okay. I'll sift the flour now. give it a really good mix right now. Get you all on. come over here. pan down back. I've got a frying pan. Was worried about fryers. Stop the fryer. just a Tesco special non-stick pan 11 pound 99 and cause the Box the cornflakes. get the heat hog and work it up. Okay, just a basic pan. I'm shallow frying. Okay, I'm not deep frying. Big difference Thank You Oscar literally agrees with it. shallow firing the way. therefore we take on less fat and more importantly, the actual flavor is delicious. Now we're studying. Okay, you want it Almost sort of like a runny texture touch. More beer. Okay, you can make this batter without the beer. Okay, now from there. once you've got that. a nice sort of liquid moving like that. Okay, whisk you finger sleep. I season it lightly. Okay with that texture. Pan down big pan down. Meg 20 gin and tonics last night girl poured into sin. No no. right now from there. literally bang the whisk gear. Egg whites okay and whisk those egg whites. now. whisk them three quarters. Okay, just if peak? okay, that means basically Tilly stop it laughing the sticking away to just open there. Don't put the top too early. Okay, now once you've got that aeration, those egg whites? Okay. look from there straight into the batter. Pen down, make pen down there you go. Excuse me, look white hand every piece for Miriam Now look at two days gone. Thank you. Look at that butter. Beautiful. You want the batter just dropping through the risk if he gets a little bit too heavy a special water in there. look at. The color in that curry powder gives that a really nice beautiful dark color. Now we have to dredge this. Let's get the fish in first. I'm gonna season the fish first before we go into the flour cuz you can't see the fish once it comes out cuz that batter stills it in. Okay now. lightly seasoned into the flour, run it through those spices and then this is really important now. Okay, knock off that flour so just feel next the right. Don't jump it. Okay, now look from there. take the fish and just literally drop that in. Yes, okay. don't get that oil too hot if it was too hot. Okay, just thank you all sunflower oil and just put a tablespoon. I'll call them there. Okay, that's why I've started with shallow fry so there's so much more control over there. Yeah, watch, lift it up and then literally from side to side use the corner of the cod and this is so beautiful. So fresh. Lay away from you. put it in. Okay I'm just literally lay away now. I've got to take it off the gas. there's no need more heat. Quick wash their hands. Okay now like I said, if you're probably gets too hot okay, add a splash of cold on to it. but look at that now. look shallow fry, turn the gas down and stick that back on there. Take a little spoon and just put the back of the spoon just face the fish. and literally this is the exciting part about basting fish. This special or a prime is shallow fry. They get really nice and crispy now look at the color that back to pan down make how we do time hold please. Four minutes gone right? Potatoes just very quickly square that off means top and bottom okay and literally square it off so it's all nice and flat so is easy to cut and they come down here Now we haven't got long so these gonna be tall skinny fries from there in and then from there look down hold them all together uniformed this is one potato but look at the yield of fries on there okay and then finally there. Now get them into a little piece of kitchen roll okay and Rob them okay When you rub them, it gets rid of the start and the moisture okay and it helps to dry the potato batter. Now lift up to the side, turn that over and then this be faced again. now. Cello Prime should take literally around three to three-and-a-half minutes. Now look at that beautiful color again, clothing size and then its face. Now once you've got to color on there, okay, the fish. That thing cooks in about three and a half minutes. that's a nice and crispy and from there I'm going to take it out. literally, drain it aside, put that onto a little piece of the paper. okay and that gets rid of the excess fat and litter that's been go in the oven for about two minutes now. The fries quack up the gas. Literally a touch of cold water in there because with a blank sheet potatoes first I've rubbed them nice and dry. and look, we're gonna go in into the same oil now. you can see the difference Now see how thin they are and he's gonna cut loose. We - it's time. please hold for Miss Don't worry, don't worry now they're in there. we blanch them now. Pillow Makers needs me. sign up now to change. The bludgeon could be always cold but a writer okay. the gas is nice and hearts are more importantly will get caught on them. now. tuck our sauce. Don't go too crazy the tartar sauce in here I've got a little bit of creme fraiche and a little bit of a little bit a little bit. okay, a little bit of mayonnaise. Now from there take your gherkins Okay, thank you to Mrs.. Thank you Right Gherkins in now I'm doing little tartar sauce okay. this is a sort of nice sort of easy clean with the creme fraiche to the bone. Nice no just a touch, just a touch and then from there touches sauce and this look you're gonna go slow and then you will be fine so little bit off it and then from there stop Now think what's happening now the fish is getting really nice okay and crispy. Other Tartar sauce that's funny, that's your salat. oh really. lemon juice and squeeze some fresh lemon there. Okay now look did you really pass your capers? You just want a really nice amount acidity in there. Other half a race and half? CalFresh that's a few tradition now. Fries look at that now so the fries are blanched. Okay the good news is now our turnings around. You can see the exciting part when with shallow frying. Okay, we shove it. fry it, cook so much better and in many ways a lot healthier. I think IQ of actually cut the actual chips just a little bit thinner. My eighth grade string source. Um okay, that's a beautiful sauce. I've got my lemon there and I see the exciting thing now when we start literally to shut a fire. it's so much better. Deep fry fish raw I Blanched them. They are not raw. Make it Megan Really panting Cannon man? Honey and honey? Yes Yes yes, just a minute. 30 seconds. Okay, color those now these four beautiful beautiful from there and tartar sauce is optional.

All the effort and dedication is extraordinary. Um and also an extra special thank you to? Well he's a legend and he's become a legend over the last three weeks. Captain Tom Moore days away from celebrating 100th birthday? Um sir, you've raised over 23 million pounds. The next time someone tells me about running half a marathon, an Ironman, an ultra marathon. If they turn around and say to me, i'm too old for that, I'm gonna reference you nearly a hundred years old and you're up and down the garden a hundred times to raise money. But there's something special going on because this goes to show how special this country is and the size of the heart where they donate in the way that even the people I know you know that are tied with their finance are still donating. So this donation is going to you tonight to say a special thank you. And more importantly, God bless sir. Now uh, should we check to see where my soup chef is? He said he'd be turning up on time, but I think he's been distracted. please? Where is he? He said he was gonna help me out but uh, excuse me. Hey hello, I just got the wind spoon. Oh no. really. Peppa Pig, I'm not going to tell you about the pigs. We are from the back garden. No, Oh okay. now what is. Oh hello. What is that chili? Could have been a bit more color on the old beef there? No. Okay, now we have a new Director of Photography. That's right. Um, in fact, she started filming at 12. we should put our braces on. We know as Matilda. you know as today. let's go to yours. now. Turn it around. Say hello to yourself, right? Okay, Uh. Pan down Tilly. Oh my God. Yes, I'm not making it okay. Panda Panda, right? Uh. Mint? Okay, I've got minced meat, a little bit of cheddar cheese, some bacon there, okay, a little bit of lettuce, tomato, an egg, egg is optional, onion, lettuce, and the buns. Why are you telling me why? So I said 10 minutes. Okay, and I got a little secret. I froze those okay little chillies. Anything left there like that Freezing because you can grate that in to sort of make that sort of almost a little bit more delicious. This is literally just plain minced beef, right? Timmy, Are we ready? Ready to start? Yes. Uh. Time goes now, right? First off, ten minutes. Dad. let's go gas on. Okay, I'm using a grill pan. Okay, but you can use a frying pan. So uh. a grill pan. Get that on and get it nice and hot. Now First off, season. A touch of salt. Touch it. Touch your pepper. Now I'm putting an egg in there. Okay, stay with your tails. Pan over. I'd like the yolk. Okay, don't use your hair. hold on. it's my burger. Uh, yolk. Okay, in Now from there. Okay, I wanna just literally get that chilli. Okay, and just grate that in there. Now the secret behind this is just give it a little bit extra heat. Okay, and when you grate it like this, it sort of disintegrates. a chili pepper. Pan up. It's me. Now it's me. It's not all about you. It's about food. And then look. Pan down, back down. Look. Oh My. God. Beautiful little chili flakes in there. Now come on. Now from there. Okay, just a touch of seasoning. Now the best thing to do is get your hands in there. okay and literally shake that. Okay, now I said shape it, not, drop it on the floor. Now here's the secret. We've got 10 minutes to make this burger. Okay, and I've got sort of 75 seconds gone. If you've got more time than I have tonight, then maybe a little bit thicker. If you haven't, then make them nice and thin. So take off a nice ball okay, almost like a sort of the size of a tennis ball and then literally start shaping those burgers like that. Now, look, get your hands around and just literally place that on. Pan down, Pan down, Pan down. Meg. I'm tilling it down so I'm gonna put literally about I'd say an inch in height. Okay, and look what that egg does. That egg actually makes it a little bit richer. Okay, now from there. quick wash their hands. First time. Um, two minutes ago. Okay, so the cooking time is about seven minutes. Okay, Oh, counting it. Five. Cut it. Very fine oil on okay, grapeseed oil. I've seasoned the burger Okay, yeah, one yes and then on. Okay, now look at that. Okay, push it down. We're gonna turn it once. Okay, I've seasoned the meat inside. Okay, so from there I want to season the meat again. On top and down to it. please. On top. There you go. Now turn up the gas. Okay, now I love onions. I'm a burger. Okay, But what I don't love is the raw onion. So get your onion slice nice and thick. Okay, down down. a touch of oil, a touch of salt and pepper on there, and look, get those onions on the grill. Look at that Beautiful. Come on. Seriously. Now, alongside that, what goes wrong with the burger? please? Chili Burger. Onions. Oh some beautiful streaky bacon. This is a streaky bacon from that wonderful butcher on Rock High Road. Now look, we're cooking all this together. I want the bacon fat going in to the burger. I want the flavor, the onions going into the burger and get that juicy toasted. Now whack up the gas. Okay, three and a half minutes. Yes, Yes, Yes. Now, whilst we're cooking the burger, okay, literally pan down for you. Put down mayonnaise. Okay, mayonnaise in a little bit of pepper. We'll take the salt and from there, come on. Oh there it. It's a little touch of heat just as the mayonnaise. Okay, mix that up. now. you could use mustard in there. Grain mustard. You could put English muffin there. You put Dijon mustard and look at that really nice spicy selector. So let's run through this. We're done. Okay, Okay. Chili. Yes. Look at that flavor. Look at the color. Little one's coming out of there. Okay, but watch this. Watch. What? Oh My. Lord. Okay, here we go. Look at those onions that is Not burnt. There's nothing worse. No. Stop that. Now the buns. The buns. The buns. The buns. What Are you already sandwiched? Excuse me, sorry. The buns are brioche buns. okay, high content. butter says be a little bit more richer so I want to get them toasted so it takes that weight of the burger. Get the buns on and toast those puns. But look, we're all in the same pan here now. Good news is, we're not even halfway yet. We're gonna make this. Push that down gently, not too hard, and flip that once. and once. only under that's still cold there. And look, get the color on the burger from there. Now look at my buns. Look at that. Beautiful Has a caramelized bun. tilly nearly burnt that is Not burnt. Stop it. Let's do it right from there. Beautiful. Now we can start to orchestrate this amazing burger. Now Pan down. Please pan down, calm down and walk. Uh, tell me your puzzling butter please. Yeah please. Right here we go. Now if you like cheese on that burger, here's a little secret. Get the cheese. Little square of cheese on there. Okay, put that on. Okay, bring that to the side and just to get that cheese melting. Okay, I take a little bit of butter and I sort of create a little bit of sort of extra flavor with the butter underneath and that's going to give it so much flavor. But look, get a pan and put the pan on and just stick that on top there like that that will help melt the cheese. Time left clean. Silly how long? Um, you have got? Let's go. I'm trying to find your timer. What? I'm working. Five minutes. No, we've got Four minutes left. Four minutes. Seriously. Now look at that bacon. I've got a bacon. okay, juicy color. Take that down there. Okay, but do me a favor till the pan and get that bacon fat pan down till you burn down To me, bake your fat inside. Pan up. Two. Look at those onions. Now. come on. Seriously. Honestly, they're the kind of onions you see on that burger van outside butt in the palace now before they come off a little bit of seasoning. Okay and just look. now. you can't smell this. But the color of those onions is incredible. I'm telling you, come on. Three minutes to go. From there. they're caramelized. Young lady. How many times have told me to do it between caramelized and burnt? Whoa. Honestly, should have gone to Space Savers right? Panda Panda Caramelized onions. They are delicious. Seriously delicious. Off and drain. Okay. off and drain. now. Pan up. Chills. Please. pan up. I'm already off. Okay, good, right. Lift the lid off. Look, if you haven't got a pan, put a bowl on top of that. But look at the cheese. The cheese starts melting. Now that looks beautiful. Right Again on there gasps, right? Let's start the process. Pan Down please. Two minutes to go. Base on there, right? Yep, we're running out of time. Lettuce first. that protects the burger. Okay, from there. a little slice time, left. Watch me let this. tomato. Oh sugar. I forgot the uh. spice. Okay, now build this baby beautifully. Okay, a little bit of salt on top of that. Now from there I'd like some onions on there. Okay, Pan down. please. pan down. Look at it already. Honestly, it's like a vegetarian delight. Come on, how beautiful is that? Plenty for the onions. The difference between grilled onions and raw onions. You'll eat way more grilled than you will raw. beautiful little seasoning. Twister pepper. Okay, from there, burger's not quite ready time. Haven't gone on. Hold on a minute and a half. left. 30 seconds left. Okay, now from there, just literally baste that okay and just gently push down gently gently, not too much gently. The bacon? okay, gonna get extra crispy back on. and then from there. I should have made it a little touch thinner. but look away, that cheese is caramelized around that burger. Now look, that is beautiful before you take that off. Yes, from there you go on with a little touch of salt on top of there. Take that bacon off. Okay, now touch. it's a little bit more in there. Problem is, now, I can't turn that burger because I'm gonna wait for the caramelized. now. you can do this in a frying pan? Okay, but think of the way we assembled it okay and think about the sort of magic involved. But if I turn that round there like that, it's literally going to burn. Dad, Yes, Sandra says you can do it. Thank you. Oh man, I made the boat. Oh, don't put that on it. Okay Oscar, Look at his face, look, look oh [Applause] And then the onions. Wait wait wait wait, But look at that. Fail. Oh my goodness me, the fibergate were cool. I mean seriously. Okay, first of all, what? Six? Where's the windscreen? [Music] I I may not have done it in 10 minutes to be honest that Ramsey's already donated to an amazing cause. Um, I can't wait to see your burger. Don't forget to hashtag Me! And more importantly, if it's good enough, I'll share it. If it's bad enough, I'll still share it Now I'm not going to eat this and I'll give it to the neighbors next door. [Music]",

We should put our braces on as today let's go to yours now. We're not all about you, it's about food. And then look, Meg I'm tilling it down, Pan down, Meg, Meg and Timmy. The chef uses a pan and pan to cook a chili burger in a bid to get the best taste of the chili. The chef says he loves onions but what he doesn't love is the raw onion. He says the buns should be toasted so it takes the weight of the burger toasted. Panda Panda Caramelized onions are delicious. You'll eat way more grilled than you will raw. Don't forget to hashtag Me! And more importantly, if it's good enough, I'll share it. If it's bad enough, he'll still share it.",

But first of all, join me in thanking the incredible staff of the NHS They have done it an amazing job I only get to see new faces but I know how hard how stressful how difficult times are for all of you right now. So behalf of the Ramseys please keep it the good work and God bless and thank you Now when I said ten minutes last we go around because Megan pan down fast enough I was overrun by 90 seconds. So mad when I say pan down, pan down okay I need to look my sous-chef he's running around somewhere. he was spotted hunt down, pan down, pat down right only months ago but she's still a baby and missus sophisticated herself who's got the lighting to make up for all of us. Not back again Holly [Laughter] First of all, hello okay yeah song, come on now on the pretty one through the angry voice at the timer I'm gonna get scrutinized if I'm running littering second zone this time my pen down pat down. we've got some amazing ok ground beef you don't got beef turkeys good chickens look lamb is give anything ground meat you've done. it's a bass. Straightforward stir-fried rice that's a literary steamed rice from last night's curry. red onion, chilies, red pepper, yellow pepper. don't get out of about the color, there's no big difference than flavor. Okay so the Matt time they sit in the Sun mushroom bok choy next to that a little bit of munch to make pen down some lifting greens up please. It looks like I won't really study twice. come on monsters. And then some ginger and some garlic. Okay, a little bit of coriander soy sauce pan down me and a little bit of olive oil okay and a touch of fish sauce so this is optional. Okay if your neck I will show you to do it with an egg. Okay now first of all, here we go right. Yes, up. Get it nice and hot. Okay, now my community partners slow down. Don't slow down too much, but it's not going to get the beef Okay, Crispy, get a pan nice and hot. Okay, put the beef and sort of almost break it up into little bits. just open up a little bit. almost like the spring 200 plates. Okay, that's gonna get it. separating the pan now from there once you've opened up that beef. okay almost in the also little granules just literally open it up that way when we come to fry it cannot make pan up pan up mate. it's really we're going to get it really nice and crispy. Now the secret here is get some color on it. Okay, so give that pan super hot now from there just like never and sort of address sort of let it almost break up into little modules just like that. From there, a little bit of seasoning okay such a salt dough about the chain will go down in a minute and then a touch of war. Now the crazy oil. Literally half a teaspoon of all in there. It's a nonstick pan and then another dot. the deep around. okay, sort of. spread it around, don't just rub in the middle which will turn the trans. All use the side of the time spider walk. It's like a large frying pan and okay. And then from there, literally slice. okay, don't worry, and a grater. Okay, look, don't worry about chopping this. Grate the ginger. Okay, that whale disintegrate so quickly. Look at that again. Grate the ginger, take the knife. will there be a spoon and look. Pull it in there. Okay, nice. From there, take the garlic pan down, make that down nice and flat. I Just carefully grate the garlic that way. it disintegrates so quickly. Look, that's my whole clove of garlic. Almost gone. that chunk, look down and down. [Music] Garlic please. And the most amazing chins up. but we got color on that. Okay, so the gas up. Now that's a reading of star. Add a touch more. okay. from there, pan down, make the peppers, take off the stalk and just slice round. That way, we leave the seeds in the middle. Okay, we don't those seeds in there and look off like that, and then from there. literally, just use the knife and go up and down. now. I'm gonna put some yellow pepper. a little bit of red in there. Like I said, there's no big difference in flavor. Okay, they literally taste the same, so don't worry now. Pepper slice I Can thinly let the knife do the work. One finger in front to behind and guide that knife across there pepper. Don't go too thin. Okay, from there, literally clean the knife down. that is called caramelized. There's nothing preventing there yellow peppers in okay. now wave that noise the time. Now we're literally coming up to six minutes to go now. Please stop. Put me off. Megan Pan down, pen down peppers in I'm not happy. Told to slow down for the other. right from there again. Such a pepper. They go in on top of the yellow. Okay, give that, tilt it down and pull back up. tilt it down, pull back. thank you. Go heating the pan and dust the outside of the pan with a touch more oil. Now make yeah, these are delicious little mangia. - okay. group them up and just go through them. just like that. Okay now. Jim Come on. Stu Green Beans Crispy. It's a stir fry. Okay, but looking good down. I'm spending all those peppers in the inside of the pan as well. Okay, from there. hot choice. The secret here is you get the big leaf, put all the small ones inside of that. Okay, chop that there and roll that nice and tight. See that like what are your friends make when they roll their cigars? [Laughter] Yes, okay, okay Mo I'm sorry, but it's it's the destruction of girls now slicing stalks here. we go from there. stalks him first, they take down seconds and then put the other tops. give the tops in there. Okay now from there. okay. we have got literally three minutes to go. Mushrooms in. now. from there, a little touch of soy in there. Okay, you got gas on a little touch of fish sauce optional. helps you season it okay. and the last thing would have put in there is SP Onions Now look slice them nice and thick I Want to taste those fingers in there? Okay, keep them there for moments. Now from there, make and down I tend to be. look at the color of that. Now that site has literally. Caroli those peppers. Yeah, you're going to put this together. Okay, you put this together way. How much rice, how much pepper, and how much meat you won in there? I'm going to show the basics now. here we go. Now this is optional. Okay, get the pan nice and hot. Okay, you take an egg. always, crank up on a flat surface, open that up. Okay, get a little fork and now they come down now from there. Matilda Please move it up. You do well again. breathing deep oil into the pan egg in and watch that goes in. Whisk that around round. I Give that egg a little seasoning from there, create the salt. Just a light touch and then lightly toss in with your rice now. Matua Look at this building, they'll keep that heat in the pan ain't described in our love. Brings in spring onions in and put some my peppers back in there. Okay and then my mix. Remember the midst of the beginning. we're going time and then look mixed up now and then. all the do very quickly. Yes, it's some coriander. I did [Music] come on please stop. I Done in ten? Yes! I took you over. But most important, there's nothing for two, three four. So you have the barriers in terms of how much how much puppy put in there. Why should I say don't wait to see what you've done, Stay strong, thank you not easily and we come together cooking. Trust me, we'll get through this. God Bless and I'll see you.",

Now I know I travel fast, work fast, do everything fast so I need to slow down. But before we start, I'd like to say a big, very special thank you to all those essential workers, especially the Nhs. You're doing an incredible job! Also, I'd like to mention the actual live they're saving Okay, which is incredible numbers for thank you and having a mum that's worked as a nurse, I know what you're going through. Continue it. Honestly Now Ramsey In 10 we're going to cook an amazing dinner in 10 minutes. But first of all, put your pans on. Don't put the oil in there, Don't put any salt in there. Just get your pan, put it on the gas, and turn the freaking thing on. That is it. Leave that to get warm. I've got a timer because when I say 10 minutes, I do mean 10 minutes. Yes, I do waffle baked. I know you makes sort of shouting at me. But before we start cooking, you know today's a very special day because this time tolerance again here they're clattering in the background. It's somebody's birthday. Now let's start off this cook along live singing a very happy Birthday to our dear beloved son Oscar who is one today. But it may be your birthday as well. It could be a birthday tomorrow, could be a birthday yesterday. But let's celebrate this incredible cook along and start singing happy Birthday Mate! Even even the dog's joining in. Now, where is he? Where is he? Where is he? Where is he? Where he's isn't he? He is in the kitchen. Oscar! Hey, happy Birthday to you! Happy Birthday! [Applause] Okay, God bless him. Dude. Happy Birthday! I know you're upset because I just pulled you out in the kitchen. That is why here we are. All right. Here's the cake. Uh, How do you have the blog ready? Ready One, Two Two Three. Make a wish. Make your wish. God Bless Peace! Um, okay. now let's go. Uh now. Um, there's no hair. There's no makeup. There's no. There's no. There's no production crew. Let me show you who the production are. These are the super talented Ramsey girls. Uh, Head of D.o.p Director of Production And she's an amazing, uh camera woman And she does know her stuff. Let me tell you, that's Megan Ramsey Second? Uh, Dp. Who is Second. Let's smile kid. it's the one. Matilda, thank you so much and I've seen this whole thing and put it together. The glue behind The girls. Holly, Holly, thank you for lending your light. Uh ladies, thank you so much And where's me Man? He's back in the kitchen. Dude, right? Dad, Come on, come on. let's go right. let's go give me the camera back there. Yes, right. First of all, let's set the timer Shall we? for 10 minutes? Yes! Now any questions? Uh, just shout. First of all, marinate the lamb Okay. Touch the sunflower oil. Little sprinkle of oil. A lot of fat on this lamb. These are lamb chops. Okay, lightly seasoned. I always mix. Pan down. please make pan down. I always mix the salt ready. Oh oh no. So there's a lot of fat on that lamb. so season it, Pan down. Please make that means bring the camera down. Okay of all the plate lightly seasoned sunflower oil and just gently season that. Okay pans are on. I'm not gonna put any, um oil in there. it's gonna get nice and hot. The secret here. I'm gonna grill those lamb chops. Look how thin they are. Got a beautiful eye of the meat, that fat around the backside is gonna be sort of rendered down. That is delicious. Next to that, I've got these new potatoes now. We had these with dinner last night so they're sort of left over ball potatoes and all we do is get them cut them in half. Okay, and the nice thing about these is they're actually going to sort of become like a sauteed potato. Okay, Pan down leg, pan down. Meg, Please pan down. Thank you. Come on Meg, We're live. Seriously, I can't have 15 fingers coming at once. First off, start the lamb. Okay, now I've got the water on boiling salt and pepper in there as well. I was trying to say earlier I mixed the salt and pepper so I just seasoned it once. Okay, it's actually two-thirds salt and one-third pepper, so it's a light sprinkling lid on peas. They are fresh frozen peas. It's the best way of making an amazing puree once that starts the smoke. If you haven't got one of those griddle pans, trust me, a normal pan will be fine. A little touch of oil in there, Just a touch because we've already put it on the lamb already. And then from there, look, rubbing the seasoning in and just lightly push them down. Now go left to right, okay, left to right and get them grilling. Beautifully done. Now, if you get any big thick chops like that, push them in and literally just push them down with your fingers. Okay, they're still cold. they're not going to burn, but just push them in there. scrape all that seasoning off. Now it's on there. Watch your fingers. and then how do we get that? A little bit more exciting with that. Get some garlic. Okay, a couple of cloves of garlic. make. hand left. Please come there. don't worry, don't worry about pinging or chopping. Knife down nice and flat palm of the hand and down. All you do is cross pan down. That's crushed garlic that goes in there. Okay, if we slice it thinly, what's going to happen is the garlic is actually going to burn. I've got some really nice butter mushrooms so I'm just going to cut these into quarters. Okay, I'm going to stick them in the same pan as the lamb. Think of the flavors going through that incredible dish. Now that fat is starting to render, let's get a really nice color on there. Put the mushrooms and the garlic in with a lamb. The flavor of those mushrooms is going to be incredible. Now for the potatoes. Time wise, seven minutes to go. Seven minutes. or now we use Touch of Olive Oil with this. Back up the gas. Okay, now if you haven't got new potatoes, normal potatoes will be fine. Get some water in there and literally place those potatoes in half and get them in. Now I'm going to get some columnar potatoes. Okay, I'll I've left the skins on. I'm absolutely good. Pan down there. Come down. Please. come down. Now. How do I turn those potatoes in? Something a little bit more exciting? Let me show you. Take a nice red onion. Okay. slice it in half, take off the roots, and then from there look just a nice little chop. Don't worry about going too fast. the speed you'll get there. Get the technique right first and then increase the speed. Listen, I'm not expecting you to do this in 10 minutes, but I am expecting to do it at 11 and a half. I can run 200 meters. No pressure, No. but hold on a minute. You're saying ball can run it in like 19 seconds. I may take 24 seconds so it's fine. Garlic on and then again, just gonna flatten it and that's gonna go in with the potatoes. Okay, really nice. Now the water's brought into the peas. Let's have a look at what's going on. Pan down, Make lamb. Do you do it? Don't turn it too early. Don't turn that lamb too early. I've been worn by a separate juicer Holly over there. I have to slow down. Water in peas. go in. okay. Frozen peas in and then from there lid back on. Turn that gas up and turn that back. Now for just over five minutes to go. Tons lift that first beautiful cutlet. Look at that sort of color on those things. So beautiful. So if you retire, yeah, I just forgot the butter. Would you mind bringing a little bit of buttercream? I should've asked her earlier that Mum makes dinner in 10 minutes every night with a baby in her hand. [Music] Please, just thank you Now Meg, Pan down. Please look at the colors. Okay, so the garlic is doing this. Stop. The lamb is rendering down a little touch of seasoning again. Now we're turning it over and now we're listening halfway through. and what I'm going to do now is put a little touch of butter into that lamb. Okay, no. they're caramelized. They're burnt. Stop that. Mom never burnt her onions. Look at the color of those now. Okay, useful color. How's the time Looking good? I've got four minutes now as those things come back up to a boil. I'm gonna crush them. Okay, and what I'm gonna serve with this is just a little touch of vinaigrette. Okay, so we'll keep this really simple. look. A tablespoon of mustard? Okay, just a tiny actually. Thank you Oscar. A little touch of cider vinegar when it comes to cider vinegar. Just a touch. Extra Virgin Olive Oil in I want a nice relaxing sauce. and then from there, look in the fridge. I had this little smoked chipotle paste that's got a little bit of heat in it. Put that in there simply done, and then put the lid back on and give that a little shake. Now look at that. Open that up. give that a little seasoning. Okay, they've got an amazing, delicious little marinade. Now look at that lamb. Now. come down mate. come down please. [music] Potatoes. You freaked out. But the butter in there as well and that's gonna help. Literally. Those potatoes. Nice and crispy. Now if I touch there, that lamb is already medium rare and that's equivalent to taking your pulse so touch touch. It's exactly the same. Take off the gas, push it to a side, and look. I've got a little spoon of vinaigrette going over that lamb. How nice does that look? Beautiful. Leave that lamb. Just sat there marinating. Okay, Potatoes are nice and crispy and this is where you see those peas turn into something more magical. So if you glance for two minutes into boiling water, drain off that water, put the pan back on the stove, pan down there, pan down, and then just look how crispy daddy look at that. That is not very. that is Bud. Excuse me. That's fun. Oh that is. We have got three and a half minutes left. right piece back in. Okay, from there. a little touch of butter. okay, crying. teaspoon of butter. Okay. and then look. come on, please. break a little touch. Okay of creme fraiche. Just half a tablespoon. I'm going to do now is literally create this evening lightly and crush, crush those peas. and what's going to happen now? It's got this beautiful sort of fresh, minty, delicious cream peas. And that creme fraiche gives a little bit of acidity and then look from there how messy you are. You just flip cheese all over the kitchen. It's a kitchen. some lemon zest. We're not going to be cleaning it up. Dad. Ten minutes guys. We've got 90 seconds to go. Please. This is the crucial moment. Correct the seasoning. Look at that. The creme fraiche in those peas. It is so beautifully. Well now for the most exciting part. when we come to dress this when we come to plate it. Okay, look at that lamb. Make pan down please. Beautiful from there. Take that lamb out. Oh my goodness. Oh oh hold on Are you over 10 minutes? I need another 90 seconds Mushroom. Remember, we're going to use the garlic guys. Okay, Mushrooms on and then get your spring onions. Okay, I know I need another two minutes, but just slice them down and throw those spring onions in to those potatoes. Okay, soft, soften them nicely and then from there looking good. they look incredible now. Potatoes are nice and crispy. Okay, very crispy. They're red onions guys. Really? Seriously? Sorry, they are not. They are crispy. They've done with one or two minutes or less. But and then finally you get those peas. A nice spoon of peas, that lemon and crepe fresh at the end. Honestly, it works wonders. and then look from there, take that light smoky vinaigrette and look. just glaze that over. [music] Come on I said you 10 minutes. Okay, so I need an extra minute. I'm getting old. [Applause] This is a beautiful part. Come on. That is the most amazing way of grilling Meg Pan up is me. Now That's the most amazing, the most amazing lamb chops. People Pee Oscar! Will you stop making all that noise in my kitchen? Please? Honestly, I'm a city to Gino and Fred The most amazing soda potatoes with caramelized red onions. Beautiful butter mushroom's been cooked in the lamb juice. but here's the magic. That lamb seriously is tender and pink. and there we have dinner in ten and a half. Ladies, what do you think? Dad? Yes, um where's the lamb sauce? Oh come on, tail's ready Only you lost that We can't No, don't We can't do lamb sauce in 10 minutes. Well you know you can't serve lamb without lamb sauce. I put a Filly grill on there. Get out out the kitchen out. Seriously. Seriously. Seriously, how do you do lamb sauce in 10 minutes? Mom could do it should I take over. [Music] You.",

The show is set to be broadcast live on BBC One tonight at 8pm on Channel One.com.com Live.com. A little touch of oil in there, just a touch because we've already put it on the lamb already, and then from there, look, rubbing the seasoning in and just lightly push them down and get them grilling. Now that fat is starting to render, let's get a really nice color on there. Now we're listening halfway through and what I'm going to do now is put a touch of butter into that lamb. Gino and Fred cooked the most amazing dinner in ten and a half minutes in ten minutes. The show's most amazing way of grilling Meg Pan up is me. The most amazing soda potatoes with caramelized caramelized spring onions are served with a light smoky vinaigrette and glaze that over.",

Mia Can you make the delicious breakfast in ten? Welcome to Ramsey in Ten Hi I'm Mia Castro And today I'm in Gordon's amazing kitchen put me up to a challenge to make breakfast in ten minutes. So today I'm making some cardamom, spiced and orange french toast. and I'm gonna show you all that you don't have to go to a fancy brunch to have a fancy breakfast. All right. So let's do some time on the clock and let's get cooking. So right here: I'm gonna make the custard to dip the french toast in I'm gonna put about half a cup of half-and-half a couple of eggs. So basic French toast Ingredients: A little bit of cardamom I love that warm sort of floral flavor that cardamom has. and I'm gonna do a little bit of orange zest. Just make sure when you zest an orange or any citrus you don't get all the way down to the pit which is the white part. Then we're gonna do a little bit of vanilla, sprinkle of salt. Let's get all together. Let me tell you something, being in this kitchen is so much easier than house kitchen because I don't have to worry about Chef Ramsay yelling down my throat. so we have the custard down and then now I'm gonna make a crust for the French toast. So during the week this may be a smoothie maker, but today we're gonna use it to make a restaurant-quality breakfast. You have anyone at home or if you're cooking for your family or lateness plane doesn't matter. This will really impress them because it adds a different element to your french toast. So we're gonna add about I don't know, like a cup or two of corn flakes. and if you don't have this little butter you can always just put it in a plastic bag I can just pound it with anything. couple spoonfuls of brown sugar so that it gets nice and golden and caramelized and to cardamom throughout the whole - and there's always just a little bit of salt there we go that just goes right next to the custard. Then we have a nice brioche loaf and I like buying the whole loaf so that I can control the thickness of the bread and that's what it's gonna make your french toast look a lot fancier. All that soaks. we can start going on the whipped cream that's gonna go on top of our french toast and it's really easy. It's just cream. a little bit of Grand Marnier which is orange liqueur and if you don't have Grand Marnier just orange zest. Oh that's just fine. I just want to get fancy. It's perfect for the late night flakes. Remember we're trying to do this in ten minutes so I'm working Two things right now. The French toast is soaking. so was your french toast. soaks up that nice custard. We're just gonna move it real quick to our sweet bread crumbs so to speak. Then we're going straight to the pan. Well, that cuts. We're gonna finish our whipped cream and it's gonna be so much more impressive than the stuff that you buy in a can. So as soon as you start getting ribbons like this, I'm gonna add some powdered sugar and I just a little by little and taste for sweetness so it's really up to you how much sugar you have. Start with. Be careful not to over whip it because it'll end up looking like butter a little separate. That should be good right there. How much time do I have? Okay, awesome, all right. so I have one minute left. So I have to get this all finished. It's actually made this at home One time for my boyfriend one day that we didn't want to go to brunch and spend money and I wanted to impress him. So I decided to do a corn flakes and blew his mind. So we've been doing it like this ever since. These are ready, but if you want to make sure that it's cooked in the middle, you can just throw it in the oven for a couple minutes and it should be fine. So we're just going straight on the plate with this and just gonna dust it with a little bit of powdered sugar. Top it off with some of that nice whipped cream. I Like to do fresh zest on top and that's how you make a fancy breakfast in 10 minutes. Gordon Please leave a comment below and let me know what you thought of my recipe. We'll see you again soon! Hi I'm Mia Castro I'm in Gordon's sorry.",

So I'm putting the challenge to Mir to see if she can make a perfect leftover dish in ten minutes. This is Ramsey and Ten hi guys! welcome to Ramsey and Ten I'm Mia Castro And today I'm being challenged to use our Thanksgiving leftovers. Today I'm using ham instead of Turkey to make a beautiful hash with some crispy potatoes and a sunny-side-up egg on top. This is probably gonna take me less time than it takes to find a parking spot on Black Friday So I have some potatoes here and I have some hot oil and we're just gonna test it real quick. If you don't have a fryer, what you do is you just drop the potato and the second it sizzles, that means it's ready. So we're just gonna cook these first and you probably have these on hand already left over from your meal. If they're cooked, that's even better. it'll be faster and then we're gonna move on to our onion. So the smaller you cut the onion, the quicker it cooks. We're gonna go in a little butter. This is something that's really easy to make for one person or a big crowd and you can get it all done in under ten minutes. So even if you're like Gordon and you don't celebrate Thanksgiving cuz they don't in the UK this is still a really delicious and hearty breakfast for any day. Your family is anything like mine. They're probably hungover from the day before because they like their rum on Thanksgiving so this will soak up all that booze from the day before. Alright, should be good right there. I'm just gonna throw this right in with the onions. Check our potatoes, stir them around. you just want to cook them until they're just golden brown because they'll finish cooking in the pan. Then while this is all cooking, we're gonna crack our eggs and get them cooking as well. We want to make sure your pans not too hot when you make your Sunny eggs. And if you miss anything, the recipes in the description below. A good thing about eggs, especially sunny-side up, is you just put them on the pan and they cook by themselves. Season minor, a little bit of pepper and you can use anything for this hash. If you have turkey, use turkey. If you have pork, that's fine beef. any meat really will work so we're almost there. Everything's cooking I'm gonna leave it alone and then just for a nice finish. I'm gonna slice some chives and it'll give it a little bit of freshness and some contrasting color so you get a little fancy with this, right? Gordon You're not the only fancy one, so you could be visiting family at home too and this dish will blow them away and it'll taste like you're making something completely different than what you had that day before. My potatoes are almost done and if you're not sure if they're done, test one. Perfect! So we're just gonna go straight into the pan and while those potatoes are still hot, you want to season them. That's when the salt sticks a little more pepper and that eggs looking beautiful. it's ready to go. So I'm just gonna turn off the heat on it. Do a little bit of chives in the hash I Like to add a little bit more butter to finish just to make it richer. It's richer because butter is delicious and it makes it taste better. I'm gonna start plating and like I said, this dish can be done in just under 10 minutes. That egg right on top, season your egg, a little bit of salt, some pepper, and some chives. Gordon You may not know what Thanksgiving is, but you will after this dish, especially because I made it in under ten minutes. Thanks for watching Ramsay and Ten and leave a comment below on what your favorite Thanksgiving leftovers are.",

I'm putting the challenge out there to see, if Mia can do in just under 10 minutes. Welcome, to Ramsay in 10. Hi, I'm chef Mia Castro, and chef Ramsay challenged me today to make a pasta dish under 10 minutes. and I'm making an all-time college favourite ramen Cacio e Pepe It's pasta with Cacio - cheese, pepe - pepper, And, I'm using ramen because it cooks within 2 - 3 minutes. And You probably have it in your pantry anyways already. So, let's start the clock and lets get started. This is some, fresh ramen. If You don't have fresh ramen, which you can find in the refrigerated section at, like your organic grocery store. You can just use, your traditional, Uhm, your traditional package ramen. They both cook in under 10 minutes. The Fresh one cooks in 2 - 3 because it's fresh. And The one in the package cooks in about the same time So All these ingredients are staples in my kitchen, so it's really easy for me to make when I've came home from a busy day at work or when it's really cold outside. and I want something hearty. In here, I have a preheated pan. Just A little too hot, so I'm gonna let it cool down and I'm gonna put some olive oil, some butter They have Gordon's fancy Peppermill here If you don't have this at home,, they sell them at the grocery store the disposable kind, either one works the same, you're gonna get the same quality meal. And I Like to do the pepper straight into the butter, Cuz it gets it really aromatic. This is another one of those dishes where you don't have to measure everything, you kind of want to do everything by tasting so it depends on how spicy you like it, how much pepper you're gonna add. I'm putting all the directions below anyway, just in case you need it, but it should be pretty easy for you to make.. I'm just gonna test one of these noodles. Great. So I'm gonna go straight into the pan with the noodles. And It's actually good if you get some of that pasta water in there. Because It will help you make a sauce with the starch Bring it onto the pan. Stir it around and I'm gonna add a little bit of that pasta water in here and what that does is it makes a really nice sauce. When you combine it with the cheese This is fresh grated Pecorino, you can use Parmesan as well, but I prefer the sharpness of the Pecorino. Few handfuls. Move it around. And you can see there how the sauce is starting to form. Pasta is one of my favorite things to eat, but I don't always have time or I don't always really want to cook. so I like using ramen in place of pasta in a lot of dishes. and I actually lived off of it in college and I would make all sorts of different things. Spaghetti, the Cacio e Pepe, carbonara, you can use it anything. Go with a little bit more water. And The beauty of ramen noodles is that it cooks a lot faster than regular pasta and it's cheap. So You don't have to go to a restaurant to get this dish. I'm gonna go ahead and taste it. A Little bit more salt. So You need to be a little more careful when you're using the traditional packaged ramen because they cook faster so you probably want to cook them a little less when they're in the water.. And as soon as they get really nice and creamy and you get a really nice tight sauce like that. They're ready to serve. I Have plenty of time to make this look great right now. So You want to get fancy, you just give it that nice swirl on top with the tongs. Give it a little height. Picture-perfect. and then just finish it off with a sprinkling of Pecorino and some fresh cracked pepper. This is a dish that you can make in well under 10 minutes. So There's no excuse for you not to make this at home. So, boom. Ramen Cacio E Pepe, Gordon. Under 10 minutes and under $10. Leave A comment below on what you think of this dish. and don't forget to subscribe to Gordon's YouTube channel. See you next time. Oh My God when I was in ramen. Sorry *laughs*",

Mia Can you make the delicious breakfast in ten? Welcome to Ramsey in Ten I am Mia Castro And you may remember me from Hell's Kitchen I'm in Chef Ramsay's Kitchen Today he's challenged me to make breakfast. and today I'm making my recipe for pumpkin spice pancakes with this recipe. I'm showing you why. There's no excuse why you can't make breakfast in 10 minutes or less I Ready to get started! Let's put the time on the clock right here. I Just have my dry ingredients. They're actually gluten free. So we have some almond flour and we're doing about a half a cup. Then we have some arrowroot starch for lightness. we have some baking powder, a couple teaspoons, and some salt. Add a teaspoon. Let's get all together. We just want to incorporate all of that. So it's even set aside for a second that were combining all of our wet ingredients. I Just eyeball it. It's about a cup of pumpkin puree and you should have this on hand from your Thanksgiving meal. We probably have some leftovers so that should be easy Three eggs. So then we're doing a teaspoon of vanilla. Combine all of this really well, adding some chai spice mix into our dry spices. and I just make a premade mix at home and it's a combination of ginger, cardamom, cinnamon cloves, allspice little nutmeg. I Like to make them ahead of time and just have it on hand. For other dishes, you can put it in french toast or put it over your coffee and then we mix in the wet and the dry. I'm just gonna transfer some of this batter into a measuring cup so it's easy to pour. so I have a griddle pan right here. I'm just gonna spray it with some coconut oil and if you don't have one, that's fine. you can just use a nonstick pan at home. I'm gonna do about a quarter cup for pancake and we're gonna cook them until they're just set on the sides and they're starting to bubble in the center. Then while these cook, I'm going to make a quick sauce for them to make them a little harder. What I have here is a little bit of melted coconut oil and so we just want to get our coconut oil nice and warm to melt this almond butter that I'm about to put in. I'm gonna do about half a cup of almond butter. maybe like don't forget your pancakes, we're gonna burn them. then when they start bubbling in the middle like this means they're ready and then I like to spray them on top [Applause] I Don't have to look perfect, it's just breakfast and you're home. but they're gonna be delicious. So while those cook I'm gonna finish my almond butter sauce. and the reason why I do this is So I'm not dousing them that much with maple syrup and I'm avoiding a little bit of that sugar and we're going with a little bit of this maple syrup to sweeten it just a bit and some of the chive spices to keep going with that theme. A little vanilla and a little bit of salt and everything that's sweet and you want to turn the heat off. You don't want it to get too hot because the almond butter will melt, just needs a little bit of sweetness and these pancakes are ready. So we're ready to serve what's the time right now. So finish it with this almond butter sauce. It's nice and sweet and salty. Some more chai spices and that's it. So another challenge I proved Gordon right. Pumpkin pancakes in ten minutes! Thank you so much for joining me! Let me know what you think in the comments below. Don't forget to subscribe to Gordon's YouTube channel for more! Ramsay Intent.",

That's why I'm putting the challenge out there to Mir to see what you can do with seafood in just 10 minutes. Mir I Hope there's some Puerto Rican Flair in this amazing dish. Welcome to Ramsay and Ten! Hi guys! welcome to Ramsay and Ten today. I'm taking one of America's biggest food crazies right now. Okay, and I'm marrying it with Big Out, which is the rice that gets stuck to the bottom of the pot and it's really famous in. Puerto Rico My family actually fights over it at the end of the night. Vamos here! I Have some leftover rice from the night before. You just want it to be a little warm for when we season it. and the way we're gonna do that is with some rice vinegar. It's about two tablespoons, a tablespoon of sugar, and a little bit of salt. That vinegar is not gonna get me, but but yeah, sorry, even vinegar won't stop me from completing this challenge. So now that we have the rice seasoned, you can taste it just to make sure. perfect. And don't worry, I'm doing this by taste, but you can find the recipe below what that seasoning does. Also the sugar is it makes it sticky. So then we get a really nice perfect rice cake. So I'm just putting a little coconut oil into this pan just enough to cover the bottom. We're gonna go straight with the rice right in and that's what you want. Medium-high and you want. to hear that sizzle? [Music] So water prevents the rice from sticking to my hands. then I can get it really flat. so the other side Chris is really nicely too. Alright, so we're gonna leave that there crisping up and while that cooks, we're gonna move on to our sushi grade. Ahi Tuna: If you can't find sushi grade ahi tuna, you can use salmon instead and we're just gonna slice it into small little cubes. This dish is really impressive because it plays with textures a lot. Like the rice is kind of chewy in the center and it's crispy. and then the tuna is really nice and savory but it doesn't feel heavy, it feels really fresh. It's a nice Island meal which is doesn't really have to be perfect times. not on my side right now and I know for Millennials and for you know, busy families it probably isn't either. So we go straight in a bowl with the tuna. We have some Mayo I'm just gonna do a little bit go to Young which is a fermented chili paste but if you don't find it, you can just do sriracha instead. It'll work just fine. some toasted sesame oil. I'm gonna check my rice which should be on this there and then The best way to flip this is have a plate. You just put the plate right over the pan. All right, Perfect. So then we're just gonna slide it back on to the pan and if it's not perfect, it's fine. It's gonna get covered up with the tuna anyway. Then we'll just slide it right back onto the pan. All right, so turn already rights is almost ready. We're just gonna cut some chives, slice our avocado and we'll be ready to go. So I'm actually gonna fan this avocado so it looks really impressive. It's gonna peel it nicely all the way to the end, but you can just cut it into cubes. it'll taste the same and then what you do is you sort of push it away from you so it fans out all right and this should be almost ready here So time is almost done. but the rice needs to get a little crispy and it's just a matter of putting everything together. I've never cooked bouquet on Hell's Kitchen but I'm sure I would have won another challenge if I would up slide it right on the plate. Going to now all over the surface this dish is amazing by yourself or if you're entertaining to share with someone else, your significant other. but it's just versatile avocado. Season your avocado and there you go. Oh that was close Gordon That's how you make a Puerto Rican poke A and just under ten minutes. Thank you so much for joining me! Leave a comment below and tell me how long it took you to make my pokey dish. And please don't forget to subscribe to a Gordon's Channel You don't tell that to a Puerto Rican woman [Laughter]",

So I'm putting the challenge out there to Mia to see what she can come up with in just 10 minutes. Mia, don't disappoint.! Welcome to \"Ramsay in 10\". Hi Guys! I'm Mia Castro, I'm the challenge Queen from Hell's Kitchen Today Gordon Challenged me to make a burger in under 10 Minutes So I'm making my version of a Tailgate turkey burger with an avocado spread and I'm adding some potato sticks for a little bit of crunch too. So Like any good football competition, Gordon you're on. Let's start So right here I have some ground turkey What I Like to add to turkey burger is because sometimes they end up being on the dry side is some zucchini To keep them moist and I'm just gonna grate it right into here And If you don't have one of these at home, You Can just use a box grater or kind of just like rough, chop it yourself And I have some pre-chopped garlic I have some smoked paprika and I like using this because It gives food that sort of like ham or bacon flavor. We're gonna try to add as much flavor as we can into the meat Everyone needs to chill out on measuring I just I Throw things in there and you can just taste it as you go. Take a little piece of burger Throw it on the grill, taste it, if it needs more, add more some salt pepper Stir that up And If you're having people over for game day, you can just make these patties ahead of time. So When you have your guests over, all you have to do is throw them on the grill or on the pan. We Don't really watch that much football in Puerto Rico At Least my family didn't, but for any game day like if it's a boxing match or for us, It's actually the Miss Universe pageant Then I'm gonna pre-boil the pan real quick because I'm about to use my hands to form these patties So The thinner the patty, the faster its gonna cook. It's really up to you how thick you want it. I'm trying to prove Gordon right though. So I Want to finish this in 10 minutes Then Right on the pan When You get the burger on. You want to make sure that your heat is on medium-high I Like it when it gets kind of crispy around it. And That's why I actually prefer turkey burgers to beef burgers You Want a list of ingredients - just check the description below. While That's cooking, I'm gonna make a quick sauce with avocados And This is a good substitution for mayonnaise and cheese. That Way you don't feel like crap after you eat a burger. Sorry This pit is Not cooperating If The pit's not cooperating. just take it out with a fork. But These knives are so sharp. They're cutting through the pit Gordon Do you actually even use your knives here? They're so sharp. All right,? whatever. We're still good! I Got this, Gordon So Just a little bit of salt, some lemon juice This is something else that you can pre make ahead of time and a little bit of olive oil. Then Just mash it up with a fork. Alright, so don't forget your burger. I'm gonna oil it on top again a little bit so it gets nice and brown on the other side. We're gonna toast our patty So, get a little bit of butter on there. So It gets a really good golden brown color. I Actually like to season the buns a little bit so you actually taste the butter. Straight down, I Think we're gonna make it, Gordon. One Nice slice of tomato. And You can top it with whatever you want, these are just my favorite things. Flatten it Check your buns, don't burn them. Oh, so I'm getting the lettuce flat so it covers The bun really nice and I get two pieces on there. I Like to put it in the bottom so that the juice from the turkey burger doesn't Make the bun soggy going with Turkey right on top So, you know if it's done by kind of poking it in the middle and if it feels firm, it's ready to go? Let's check our bun Perfect I Like to season my tomato. A Little olive oil as well. It's getting really close now. These avocados could have ruined me. I Think they still have it though.. Magic touch...\"papitas\" (potatoes in Spanish) Get a lot of them on there. That's what makes it really good. And Time is ticking so I got to get this on. There We go. Oh my God, I think that was just ten minutes. Gordon, you almost had me. but there you go.
