This Begs the question: Does The language we speak shape the way we think? The Kuuk Thaayorre, an Aboriginal group, don't use words like "left" and "right" for time. Some languages don't have exact number words, like "seven" or a word like "eight" Russian Speakers have to differentiate between light blue, "goluboy," and dark blue, in Russian, "siniy" In English, it's fine to say, "He broke the vase," in Spanish, you might be more likely to say "The vase broke" If it's an accident, you wouldn't say that someone did it. Spanish speakers might be less likely to remember who did it if it was an accident. This has implications for blame and punishment. Language guides our reasoning about events.

what year did the first computer run deep blue	Camille Martnez: Over the next 20 years, more will change around the way we do our work than in the last 2,000 years. He says we're on the cusp of our next great era as a species: Welcome To the Augmented Age. Tools are making a leap from being passive to being generative, he says. Generative design tools use a computer and algorithms to synthesize geometry to come up with new designs all by themselves. In 1952, computer scientists built a computer that could play Tic-Tac-Toe. 45 years later,, in 1997, Deep Blue beats Kasparov at chess. 2011, Watson beats these two humans at Jeopardy. And a couple of weeks ago, AlphaGo's AlphaGo beats the world's best human at Go, which is the most difficult game that we have. What's basically happening is computers are going from being like Spock to being like Kirk. We're going to see a world where we're moving from things fabricated to things that are farmed. We'll move from being isolated to that which are moving away from things which are constructed. And I think we'll shift from craving obedience from valuing autonomy, and valuing our things to valuing them.

how much battery does the topony 12 have	This phone has a Snapdragon 8, Gen 2 with 8 gigs of RAM, a 6.7 inch 1440p, 120 Hertz OLED display, triple cameras and a 5 000 milliamp hour battery with 80 watt charging for 699 bucks. The Hasselblad branding is back and we'll talk about the cameras in a minute. The OnePlus 11 has a 5,000 milliamp hour battery. It has 80 watt charging in the US and other versions have 100 watt charging. The only reason I'm not going to keep dailying this phone though aside from other phones that I have to test very soon, is the software.

That's a little more annoying over time. But the good thing is other than that, there's a lot of nice things like in this software. it's very well thought out and laid out. I think if OnePlus really wants to sort of redeem themselves and they look back a little bit at what was so successful with oxygen OS. I Know they eventually did this merge thing with Oppo and color OS.

how does exercise protect your brain?	A professor of neuroscience, as a neuroscientist, I used my deep understanding of neuroscience to essentially do an experiment on myself in which I discovered the science underlying why exercise is the most transformative thing that you can do for your brain today. Simply moving your body, has immediate, long-lasting and protective benefits for the brain, and that can last for the rest of your life. A single workout can improve your ability to shift and focus attention, and that focus improvement will last for at least two hours. The most transformative thing that exercise will do is its protective effects on your brain. The more you're working out, the bigger and stronger your hippocampus and prefrontal cortex gets. Wendy Suzuki: "I Want to understand the optimum exercise prescription for you, at your age,, at your fitness level,, for your genetic background,, to maximize the effects of exercise today, and also to improve your brain and protect your brain the best for the rest of your life. But it's one thing to talk about exercise, and it's another to do it. So I'm going to invoke my power as a certified exercise instructor, to ask you all to stand up. It's call-and-response, just do what I do, say what I say, and make sure you don't punch your neighbor, OK? Music!

is the oneplus phone the same as the iphone pro?	This phone I think could have been an awesome deal, but it's actually kind of frustrating how close it gets. The design is, I'm gonna say acceptable, but pretty generic like it's a rounded polycarbonate plastic shell and plastic rails. It would have been nice if they separated themselves from all the other glossy, fingerprinty plastic phones that are out there. This has a different sensor, but the same size primary 48 megapixel chip in there. It has the exact same ultrawide, which is one of the best in any phone. It drops the telephoto but keeps the two megapixel black and white camera. The alert slider on this phone is also much looser than it was on my Pro, and it's so loose that it's particularly easy to switch it to ring. For people who value the Oneplus software experience like the the the clean, near stock type of look, the the fast and smooth experience, the fast charging that they offer, all of that. It's exactly the same as the phone that costs 240 dollars more, whether you believe it deserves to cost that or not, That's what makes this actually a pretty good deal.

what's the difference between an ipad air and an ipad pro?	This is the new 2022 Ipad air with the new M1 chip inside. The Ipad Air starts at 5.99 and the 11 inch Ipad Pro starts at 7.99. This is one of the stranger Apple products that I've seen in a long time because of its price. The Ipad Pro has a faster 120hz refresh rate that makes everything about using the Pro smoother and snappier and more responsive. The Pro has quad speaker audio instead of the dual speakers of the Ipad Air. The Air has a single camera, no flash, so you know for the occasional video call or document scanning. Ipad Air is another great spec bump that actually makes me even more frustrated that Ipad Os is not evolving to fully take advantage of it. Apple clearly has a baseline ipad, an Ipad Pro, and an IPad Air, and most people don't need to spend the extra money to get the most premium ipad Pro.

what is the difference between pro and ipad	This is the new 2022 Ipad air with the new M1 chip inside. The Ipad Air starts at 5.99 and the 11 inch Ipad Pro starts at 7.99. This is one of the stranger Apple products that I've seen in a long time because of its price. The Ipad Pro has a faster 120hz refresh rate that makes everything about using the Pro smoother and snappier and more responsive. The Pro has quad speaker audio instead of the dual speakers of the Ipad Air. The Air has a single camera, no flash, so you know for the occasional video call or document scanning.

how much longer is apple watch	The Apple Watch Series 7 is a minor update to the original Series 6S. The new watch has a slightly larger display and slightly faster charging. The screen is up to 41 millimeters smaller than the original version of the watch. There are a few special features for the Series 7 that specifically work best for the larger display. This is now the most durable Apple watch ever. It charges 33 faster now, so same battery life about a day and a half. The watch is now brighter when you're not looking at it, but this new watch is slightly slightly more readable from off axis. My biggest disappointment actually with these watches though, the color choices. Apple is now selling the Series 7, SE and the low end Series 3. The main differences between Series 7 and SE are the larger always on display this set of colors of course and there's a couple extra sensors like for blood oxygen and the electrocardiogram. There's a new Apple event literally next week.

who said i do speaking arabic	Timothy Doner was featured in a New York Times article called, "Adventures of a Teenage Polyglot" Doner: "I've always been interested in talking about the why and the how, why I was learning foreign languages,, how I did it,. instead, it turned into a bit of a circus, in which media shows wanted to sensationalize my story" Tim Doner started taking Arabic when he was 14 in a summer program going into 9th grade. After a month he found that he could read and write without a problem. But six months into a year, into even two years later, he can't converse with anybody. He recorded himself speaking Arabic into his computer screen, subtitled it and uploaded it to YouTube. Tim Obeidallah says he's blown away by the number of languages you can hear on a given day in New York. He says he learned to memorize vocab in batches of sounds that were similar to each other in languages like Indonesian, Farsi, Hebrew, Arabic, Arabic and Arabic. So he says he tries to talk to people all day, get their views on things, and use his new found language skills. If you want to learn Persian for example, you say, "I know how to say 'thank you' in Farsi. Oh, I speak Persian." In fact,:: If you buy something in a Persian bookstore, you might ask someone 'how much is this?'. Generally, he will tell you this: "Ghabeli Nadaareh" which means, 'it's worthless' In fact: I've often heard this phrase when I talk with Iranians, "Ghorbanet Beram." Which literally means, "May I sacrifice my life for you"

why do stars create the goldilocks conditions for complexity	We all know in our heart of hearts that the universe does not travel from mush to complexity. This is reflected in one of the most fundamental laws of physics, the second Law of Thermodynamics, or the law of entropy. The universe can create complexity, but with great difficulty. Complex things get more fragile, more vulnerable; the Goldilocks conditions get more stringent and it's more difficult to create complexity. From about 200 million years after the Big Bang, stars begin to appear all through the universe, billions of them. Stars will create the Goldilocks conditions for crossing two new thresholds. When very large stars die, They create temperatures so high that protons begin to fuse in all sorts of exotic combinations, to form all the elements of the periodic table. Now, the next stage introduces entities that are significantly more fragile, significantly more vulnerable,. But they're also more creative and capable of generating further complexity. Sixty-five million years ago,. an asteroid landed on Earth near the Yucatan Peninsula, creating conditions equivalent to those of a nuclear war, and the dinosaurs were wiped out. Then from about 500 years ago,, humans began to link up globally through shipping, through trains,, through telegraph,, through the Internet,. Until now, we seem to form a single global brain of almost seven billion individuals, learning at warp speed.

when was the last eruption of stromboli	The Stromboli Volcano erupted again this week, the last major eruption took place in 2019. It's the first time humanity was able to move the trajectory of a Celestial body. NASA's Dart Mission has exceeded even NASA's wildest dreams. We'll hear more from CNN's Space and Defense correspondent. The Samara Private Game Reserve in South Africa's great Kuru region is home to over 60 species of mammal. In 2019, the Tompkins family reintroduced Lions to the reserve after an absence of almost two centuries. Koi: "There's no feeling more Primal than walking in the bush. It's almost like a rewilding of the self"

what are the effects of childhood trauma	Dr. Michael Burke: Exposure to childhood trauma can lead to higher risk of heart disease, lung cancer. He says doctors today are not trained in routine screening or treatment. Burke: Adverse Childhood Experiences Study is something that everybody needs to know about. Burke says doctors should be trained in screening and treatment of childhood trauma. A person with ACE score of seven or more had triple the lifetime risk of lung cancer and three and a half times the risk of ischemic heart disease. Even if you don't engage in any high-risk behavior, you're still more likely to develop heart disease or cancer. High Doses of adversity not only affect brain structure and function,, they affect the developing immune system, developing hormonal systems,. and even the way our DNA is read and transcribed.. At first I thought that we marginalized the issue because it doesn't apply to us. That's an issue for those kids in those neighborhoods. But then, the more I talked to folks, I'm beginning to think that maybe I had it completely backwards. Maybe It's easier to see in other zip codes because we don't want to look at it. We'd rather be sick. Fortunately, scientific advances and, frankly, economic realities make that option less viable every day.

why is the pixel 3a cheaper	The Pixel 3a is all plastic instead of glass, but they've done a great job of making it feel similar to the touch. The only place you're losing out on build quality of this cheaper phone is the lack of wireless charging and no water resistance. And then you actually gain a headphone jack. On the 3a, you can still easily easily block the one side that audio comes out the bottom grille, but again, at least it's still just half of the speaker pair. The Pixel 3a does not have the dedicated image processing chip or pixel visual core that the flagship has. The phone also has slower internal storage than other flagships, and I can tell in the speed of opening bigger apps. The Pixel 3a chops down in a couple places where some other mid-range phones wouldn't have. It doesn't have the super high-end specs and it's just never gonna feel blazing fast. But it does bring down a lot of those things from higher end phones like its big brother that we love.

when was drugs first banned	It's now exactly 100 years since drugs were first banned in the U.S. and Britain, and we then imposed that on the rest of the world. I was looking at some of the addicts in my life who I love, and trying to figure out if there was some way to help them. I realized there were loads of incredibly basic questions I just didn't know the answer to, like, what really causes addiction. And I realized that really blew my mind is, almost everything we think we know about addiction is wrong. I think we're going to have to change a lot more than our drug policies. In the '70s, Professor Alexander built a cage that he called "Rat Park," which is basically heaven for rats. But in Rat Park, they don't like the drug water, they almost never use it compulsively. None of them ever overdose. You go from almost 100 percent overdose to zero percent overdose when they have happy and connected lives. In 2000, Portugal had one of the worst drug problems in Europe, one percent of the population was addicted to heroin. They punished people and stigmatized them and shamed them more, and every year, the problem got worse. A massive program of job creation for addicts, and microloans for addicts to set up small businesses. The goal was to make sure that every addict in Portugal had something to get out of bed for in the morning. "It's hard loving an addict, and there's going to be lots of people who know in this room. You are angry a lot of the time, and I think one of the reasons why this debate is so charged is because it runs through the heart of each of us,, right? Everyone has a bit of them that looks at an addict and thinks, I wish someone would just stop you. And I think the core of that message -- you're not alone, we love you -- has to be at every level of how we respond to addicts, socially, politically and individually.

who is the leader of zen hospice?	John Sutter: The scariest thing about death isn't being dead, it's dying, suffering. He says healthcare was designed with diseases, not people, at its center. Sutter says we have a monumental opportunity in front of us to rethink and redesign how it is we die. Bob Greene: We ask too much of our hospitals for what they can do; I am alive because of them. Greene: Hospitals are places for acute trauma and treatable illness, but they are no place to live and die. Zen Hospice Project in San Francisco has a ritual to usher in grief with warmth, rather than repugnance. Greene says we need infrastructure to handle seismic shifts in our population. "Play" may sound like a funny word here, but it is also one of our highest forms of adaptation. Caretaking becomes a creative, generative, even playful act, says Zen Hospice founder. Caregiver: We need to lift our sights, to set our sights on well-being, so that healthcare can become about making life more wonderful, rather than just less horrible.

"Play" may sound like a funny word here, but it is also one of our highest forms of adaptation. Caretaking becomes a creative, generative, even playful act, says Zen Hospice founder. Caregiver: We need to lift our sights, to set our sights on well-being, so that healthcare can become about making life more wonderful, rather than just less horrible.
who is bob greene	John Sutter: The scariest thing about death isn't being dead, it's dying, suffering. He says healthcare was designed with diseases, not people, at its center. Sutter says we have a monumental opportunity in front of us to rethink and redesign how it is we die. Bob Greene: We ask too much of our hospitals for what they can do; I am alive because of them.

what kind of screen does samsung galaxy phone come in?	This is the new updated fixed Samsung Galaxy fold. Samsung announced a crazy folding phone in February. It's the same phone with six cameras, three on the back, all really high-end two on the inside, and one front cover. Samsung recalled all those review units, they took mine back, and they took them behind closed doors and started working on figuring out what went wrong and trying to fix it. It's still going to be a soft plastic because it still has to fold in half in ways that hard glass can't so much so there's a new warning on the screen during the setup process that includes a warning to avoid pressing the screen hard because it's still true that if you did your fingernails into the plastic or accidentally scratch this protective layer at the top, or even just press it way too hard, you can actually damage the Galaxy fold.

where is the word snow	A prominent research group in Washington conducted a war game simulation of a possible conflict between China and Taiwan. Thousands of temperature records were shattered in an historic winter warm spell across Europe. Alpine ski resorts have closed or at least partially shut down because of a lack of snow. There are over 400 words in Scotland for snow with Flindricken meaning a light snow. The UK Met Office said last year's sweltering heat which ran Rivers dry and caused the drought in parts of England was the country's hottest on record. At the Consumer Electronics Show, companies are showcasing cutting-edge gadgets and gizmos designed to help solve some of the world's greatest challenges from the day to the life-saving. Watch a demo of an at-home defibrillator, a device that the company says saved 17 lives.

what is the highest megapixels camera on a samsung cell phone	The Galaxy S20 Ultra is Samsung's highest and most expensive flagship phone ever. It's a massive phone glass sandwich with a gigantic, recognizable double camera bump, expandable storage at the top, speaker at the bottom, rip headphone jack. The phone has a 6.9 inch diagonal display, 120 Hertz 1440p, 108 megapixels, 100x Zoom 8k 5, 000 milliamp hours 120 HertZ 1440p 5g. The S20 Ultra has a 5,000 milliamp hour battery. The main 108 megapixel main camera is massive, but the ultra wide, ultra wide camera is the softest of the three cameras. The camera is better in some ways than their previous cameras, but worse in other ways actually, so it still falls solidly in third place. The Galaxy S20 Ultra will also shoot 8k video, a new feature these Snapdragon 865 phones are getting and that should be right up my alley. At 33 megapixels, there's some test clips out there, but it's not just simply a higher resolution version of the already pretty good 4k video. It punches in a lot, so at 4k in normal video mode, it could shoot pretty wide without binning for 8k, but they use an 8k window in the middle of the sensor. The 48 megapixel periscope camera sits in the side of this phone. The camera takes the sharpest images at 30x zoom I've ever seen from a phone next to Huawei. Despite all this hype, Samsung is kind of in the same place they left off last year. Most people will do great with a phone half this price. But as a fan of tech, I am happy when stuff at the highest end is pushing things forward and it's at the bleeding edge. Some people who use their phone a lot won't have a big problem spending a lot extra.

which genetic mutation causes autism?	Autism is not a single condition, it's actually a spectrum of disorders, a spectrum that ranges, for instance, from Justin, a 13-year-old boy who's not verbal, who can't speak, who communicates by using an iPad to touch pictures to communicate his thoughts and concerns. One of the things I'm going to spend a lot of time focusing on are the genes that can cause autism. Not because genes are the only cause of autism, but it's a cause that we can readily define the biology and better understand how the brain works. In some individuals with autism, it is genetic! That is, that it is one single, powerful, deterministic gene that causes the autism. In other individuals, it's actually a combination of genes in part with the developmental process that ultimately determines that risk for autism. Genetic information is organized into a set of 46 volumes, and when we did that,, we had to be able to account for each of those 46 volumes. We're starting to have a bottom-up approach where we're identifying those genes, those proteins, those molecules,. Understanding how they interact together to make that neuron work is critical. Early diagnosis is a key for us. Early diagnosis of someone who's susceptible at a time in a window where we have the ability to transform, to be able to impact that growing, developing brain.

what is the htc u12	The HTC u12 plus is one of the only flagships available in 2018 with no Notch and a couple super unique features. It will be available online for 849 bucks so that's definitely high end. The squeeze is back and it's like leveled up. It still has the side squeeze sensitivity from the U11, so you can set a shortcut to launch something when you squeeze the phone, but also have different types of squeezes. The power button and volume button on the side of this phone aren't normal clicky actuating buttons. When the phone is off and you press the volume buttons, they don't move. It doesn't feel as real and it becomes really obvious when you try to double press any of these buttons. Double tapping the volume buttons doesn't raise the volume twice twice and this is not fun at all. HTC Sense UI is on top of Android 8.0 Oreo and hopefully with Android P coming very soon and I've never had a problem with HTC Sense. Camera's biggest flaw is that it tends to overexpose, making things a little bit too bright and you'll notice it doesn't have the best dynamic range. HTC U12 Plus is a flagship worthy of your consideration. HTC is not always tops or first to update their phones to the new OS but fingers crossed, they get to Android P soon.

what is the difference between an artist and an artist?	Poems from daily newspapers are ephemeral, they stack up in the recycle bin. Artist's job is to collect ideas, and the best way I Know to. collect ideas is to read daily newspaper. Poems were created by artist Tom Phillips, who has been doing this for forty years. Every new idea is just a remix or mash-up of one or two previous ideas. Nothing is completely original. All creative work builds on what came before. Picasso had a saying, he said, "Good Artists copy, great artists steal." And, I've always been shameless about stealing great ideas. I'm interested in stealing the things that really mean something to me. Wendy Macnaughton the artist does, I want you to rip off everyone you've met. All The speakers you've heard take a nugget of something that resonates with you. The People you bump into today, later, take something from them, but bring it back to your desk. Transform it into something completely new. And That's how you steal like an artist.

what is the pixel?	The Pixel 6a has a 6.1 inch flat 1080p Oled display at 60 Hertz with a top center hole punch, and an in-display fingerprint reader. This phone is Ip67, not Ip68 and there is no wireless charging. There is no headphone jack, so again, if you use the headphone jack. Everything else about the Pixel here is exactly what you'd expect. The only variables that could have come up as a surprise potentially would be battery or cameras. Google's smartest features are all here, like assistant call screening is awesome, live translate, and the sorcery that is basically instant speech to text everywhere in this phone. The Pixel 6a turns out is really all about the Google software experience and the camera. For the price, that's where it excels. And while good phones aren't getting cheap cheap phones are still very much getting good. If you're shopping around, keep your eyes open because there's a bunch of good stuff.

what is the cause of anxiety and depression	The author has written a book about the causes of depression and anxiety. He traveled 40,000 miles around the world to find out what causes them. He says there are nine different causes, two of them are in our biology. But most of the factors that have been proven to cause depression are not in biology. They are factors in the way we live, he says. In 2001, Dr. Summerfield happened to be in Cambodia in 2001, when they first introduced chemical antidepressants for people in that country. The local doctors, the Cambodians, had never heard of these drugs, so they were like, what are they? And he explained to him, "We don't need them, we've already got antidepressants" But the leading medical body in the world, the World Health Organization, has been trying to tell us for years, based on the best scientific evidence. If You're depressed, if you're anxious, you're not weak. You're not, in the main, a machine with broken parts. You're a human being with unmet needs. We are the loneliest society in human history, writes Emma Watson. Watson's new book, The Loneliest Society by Emma Watson, is published by Simon Cowell. Watson: We're the first humans ever to disband our tribes, and It is making us feel awful. But It doesn't have to be this way, writes Watson. The solution to these problems does not lie in drawing more and more on your resources as an isolated individual -- that's partly what got us in this crisis. And that really connects to one of the other causes of depression and anxiety that I wanted to talk to you about. We've been trained to look for happiness in all the wrong places,. We've all been fed since birth, a kind of KFC for the soul. It took them away from this hurricane of depression-generating messages, training us to seek happiness in the wrong places. But with all the solutions that I saw and have written about, and many I can't talk about here, I kept thinking, you know: Why Did it take me so long to see these insights? Because when you explain them to people -- some of them are more complicated, but not all -- it's not like rocket science, right? At Some level,, we already know these things. Why Do we find it so hard to understand? I Think there's many reasons, but I Think one reason is that we have to change our understanding of what depression and anxiety actually

why was the kurch bridge hit	The 12-mile Kurch straight Bridge linking Crimea to Russia was hit by a blast that killed at least three people. The attack also did significant damage to the bridge, which is an important supply chain for Russian troops fighting in southern Ukraine. U.S Manufacturing has increased its profits by more than a billion dollars, offering hundreds of thousands of jobs each month. The Supreme Court is hearing a case that could decide the Internet's future. Both Democrats and Republicans believe the law makes social media companies too powerful by shielding them from getting sued when users post harmful content on their platforms. The case could impact companies that don't remove content, even when it violates their policies.

why was net neutrality called the end of the internet	The deep web is the hidden part of the Internet, a place where people communicate secretly and securely away from the prying eyes of governments. All sorts of people use the deep web tools to be anonymous on the Internet. Wekkesser suggests that we all start to think about learning some of the secrets of the 'black arts' If We are not careful, we are heading towards a two-tiered Internet, a nice, superfast Internet for those who can pay, and a kind of rubbishy one for those. The end of net Neutrality is called "the end of Net Neutrality" The Streets are safe today because so many criminals have migrated to digital where they can carry out their crimes in the comfort of their living rooms. We are looking at the end of the Internet as we know it because the Internet is being taken over by all the wrong people. We should all be saying: "I'm as mad as hell at all the spying, at the commercial takeover, and all the criminals and sickos around to get us"

Wekkesser suggests that we all start to think about learning some of the secrets of the 'black arts' If We are not careful, we are heading towards a two-tiered Internet, a nice, superfast Internet for those who can pay, and a kind of rubbishy one for those. The end of net Neutrality is called "the end of Net Neutrality" The Streets are safe today because so many criminals have migrated to digital where they can carry out their crimes in the comfort of their living rooms. We are looking at the end of the Internet as we know it because the Internet is being taken over by all the wrong people. We should all be saying: "I'm as mad as hell at all the spying, at the commercial takeover, and all the criminals and sickos around to get us"

how to ask a question in your head	We are all trapped inside our own heads, and our beliefs and our understandings about the world are limited by that perspective, which means we tell ourselves stories. I've had a 20-year career in the UK staging big psychological experiments on TV, and now that's on Netflix. And I've got my first stage show actually coming up, called "Secret" Jessica: "Will I sell the farm in Virginia?" Man: "I am standing. I'm not that short. Are You standing? Where are you? Man: I am standing. Jessica: I just got back from India. There's just a tiny, tiny little thing going on there, DB: It's a yes. If you can just find a question in your head,, make it clear and succinct,, just send it to me, and I'll try and do this now without anything written down. So Just start to form questions, but send me your name as well. The Point of writing the question is only that it just kind of gets a nice, clear, succinct wording. Allan: "I love doing this is that it reminds me at least to try and be more alive and alert to the complexity and the subtlety of what's real" Allan: "Life isn't all about us. There's always other stuff going on that we don't know about"

what is the difference between the baseline imac and imax	The new Imac is a far better computer than the baseline 21.5 inch Imac it replaces. The screen is bigger and it comes much closer to the edges than that old Imac design. The only thing that got worse is the port situation, which I'll go over in a bit. The Imac is 11 and a half millimeters thin, thinner than a Macbook Pro, and thinner than an Apple Watch. Most of the computer is down there in the bottom of the bottom, and most of it is cooling and speakers throughout the rest of the screen. I get that it's iconic to the Imac to have this chin, even though they got rid of the actual icon the logo, but I just think it would have looked better without the chin. The Baseline Imac starts at 12.99 and that's that's the cheapest one, but that particular one has almost no ports. That desktop has a headphone jack and two Thunderbolt Usb C ports. If you upgrade to the higher spec models that start at 14.99 then you have two more Usbc ports for a total of four.

who is the president of nigeria	Friday marked one year since Russian President Vladimir Putin launched a large-scale attack of neighboring Ukraine. Ukrainian President Vladimir Zielinski vowed to push for a Ukrainian victory in 2023. Up next, we'll hear from CNN International Correspondent Larry Madow as Nigerians elect their next president and vice president. There are 18 people running, but only three men have a realistic chance of becoming the next president of Africa's most populous nation. At least 200 polling stations where voting didn't take place because of insecurity and security has been a major issue for voters. MLB is implementing a pitch clock sort of like a shot clock in basketball pitchers and batters.

who says the wages of sin is sin?	LZ Granderson: In 2013, I had a bad season in life, and I was lonely. He says he fell for some of the lies that our culture tells us that success is fulfilling. LZ: "The wages of sin are sin. And My sins were the sins of omission-- not reaching out, failing to show up for my friends,. evasion, avoiding conflict" Paul Tillich: Suffering's great power is that it's an interruption of life. It Reminds you you're not the person you thought you were. The Second thing you discover is your soul. The Problem you have is not going to be solved at the level of consciousness on which you created it. So What do you do? Well, The first thing you do is throw yourself on your friends and you have deeper conversations that you ever had before. But the second thing you have to go out alone into the wilderness. You Go out into that place where there's nobody there to perform, and the ego has nothing to do, and it crumbles, and only then are you Weavers are not living an individualistic life, they're living a relationist life,. they have a different set of values, they have moral motivations. Some of these people have had tough valleys. They have radical mutuality, and they are geniuses at relationship. And What they see is joy. Joy is not the expansion of self, it's the dissolving of self. The First mountain mindset is about individual happiness and career success. But We're in a national valley, because we don't have the other mindset to balance it. We No longer feel good about ourselves as a people, we've lost our defining faith in our future,. We don't see each other deeply,. We need a lot of changes, but We also need a cultural and relational revolution.

what is the apple watch chips	The Red Apple Watch Series 6 has been wearing it every day since the Impressions video now, so been living with it. There's really not a whole ton of massively new stuff as you already knew. But a lot of the stuff that makes the Apple watch the Apple Watch and so good is of course in the software watchos that's gonna make its way to other Apple watches. The real best feature of the Apple Watch Series 6 is just the new S6 chip inside that's what's giving you the great efficiency to last all day. If you disable the oezon display, you'll probably get even better battery life and then it's enabling the faster charging. The new solo loop bands are a great idea and I love the simplicity to put it on, no velcro or buck magnets or buckles. The new Apple Watch Se has the new S6 chip but there's no electrocardiogram and no blood oxygen sensor. It's a much lower price and that's fine for most people getting their first Apple watch. Most people don't even need this newest version with all the bells and whistles and extra sensors.

what are the differences between introvert and extrovert	When it comes to creativity and to leadership, we need introverts doing what they do best. A third to a half of the population are introverts. Shyness is about fear of social judgment, social stimulation, including social stimulation. Extroverts crave large amounts of stimulation. We need more of a yin and yang between introverts and extroverts' need for lots of stimulation. We have this belief system that I call the new Groupthink,, which holds that all creativity and productivity comes from a very oddly gregarious place. The key to maximizing our talents is for us all to put ourselves in the zone of stimulation That is right for us. In fact, we have known for centuries about the transcendent power of solitude. We can't even be in a group of people without instinctively mirroring, mimicking their opinions. Groups famously follow the opinions of the most dominant or charismatic person in the room, even though there's zero correlation between being the best talker and having the best ideas. My Grandfather was a Rabbi and he was a widower who lived alone in a small apartment in Brooklyn. His favorite thing to do in the whole world was to read. But he also loved his congregation, and you could feel this love in the sermons that he gave every week for the 62 years. So these days I try to learn from my grandfather's example in my own way, so I Just published a book about introversion.

what is the new macbook air	Apple has redesigned the Macbook Air around Apple silken with M2 Talk. This is our first look at what's possible with Apple in a thin and light form factor. The M2 Macbook Pro, which is thicker, is still going to be an overall battery champ, but I mean the 15 hours of claimed web browsing translated for me to an entire work day of use with 20 plus percent left. The new design, I like it a lot. It is remarkably thin. It's not the thinnest and lightest laptop in the world, but it's one of those, like I could carry it everywhere type things. At some point with a sustained workload, this laptop is going to get so hot without a fan that it has to throttle to not overheat. And this one with a fan will keep going at its normal performance. Apple's new Macbook Air starts at 11.99 for 1200 dollars. Base version also has just eight gigs of memory, but 256gb version is significantly slower than the rest of the lineup. 14-inch Macbook Pro runs circles around this laptop at the same price and has a way nicer screen for that creative stuff.

It's mostly white and has red eyes, but it's not the same as Princess Daisy. The robot will be in great shape when he finds out he's not a robot. He will be able to flip a big ol' pancake that's like not bad. Remember? What does peepers know about the creature? That was a fantastic job Deepest, And we will reward you with your inevitable death. Remember? Thanks for 10 minute power hour and thanks to people now of Graded to be pissed. Remember. really?

who was the man on the show shirtless date rapist	"Male Escort #1," "Shirtless Date Rapist" "I've been pretending to be strong when I felt weak, confident and tough when really I was hurting," he says. "This is the script that we've been given. This is what's being subconsciously communicated to hundreds of millions of young boys and girls all over the world, just like it was with me" A lot of us men are really good at making friends, and talking, just not about anything real. But if it's about our insecurities or our struggles, our fear of failure, then it's almost like we become paralyzed. So some of the ways that I have been practicing breaking free of this behavior are by creating experiences that force me to be vulnerable. Fitness mogul says he's had to take a real, honest look at the ways that he's unconsciously been hurting the women in his life, and it's ugly. He challenges men to see if they can use the same qualities that you feel make you a man to go deeper into yourself. We need your help in celebrating our vulnerability and being patient with us as we make this very, very long journey from our heads to our hearts. And Finally to parents: instead of teaching our children to be brave boys or pretty girls,, can we maybe just teach them how to be good humans?

how mentors help you	In Hollywood, everybody wants something, but not everybody gets what they want. I'm from Hollywood, the "Land of Dreams," or for most people, it's the land of broken dreams. Mentors have the power to do this in your life, but in the next few minutes, I'm going to show you how mentors can transform your life. TED Talk's John Sutter says he had an idea of how to design his life. He says he wrote a letter to his grandfather asking him to help him design his own life. His grandfather replied: "Sorry, Tai, I can't help you. The Modern world's too complicated. You will never find all the answers from just one person" Sutter: "There's this myth that you have to go inward to find truth" You should divide up your life and spend 33% of your time around people lower than you. Mentors - your ability to copy - is the biggest predictor of success that you will have in life. Albert Einstein had a mentor growing up. Jay-Z, the rapper, Oprah Winfrey said she had two mentors. In-person mentors are amazing. The Media has tricked us. Bill Gates started at 12. It wasn't until 31 years old that he was a billionaire. The average American buys 17 books a year, reads at least one a month. Stoic versus Epicurean: "A nation is born stoic and dies Epic" There's a saying, "If you're in a room and you don't know who the sucker is, you're the sucker" Toughen up. Find a mentor, no matter if you're just starting out. There's always someone to learn from. You must follow those rules. Be Humble. Be humble. Persevere. Find A mentor. If You do these things, you will find the good life.

how thick is the ipad pro	Apple Magic keyboard case for the new Ipad Pro is the most interesting case we've seen in a long time. This is the best version of the ipad as a computer for sure, but I would still rather have a laptop. It's a bit thicker and heavier than a Macbook Air. There's no function buttons at all on this keyboard, meaning there's no brightness, volume, or even keyboard backlight brightness shortcuts here for all that: you gotta touch the screen. It's better than you might expect, but from experience it's still not as flexible as a truly bottom weighted laptop where the hinge is just moving the screen weight. This is a Go. This is awesome. Spring the 300 bucks but for me, I'm not getting rid of my laptop, but that's been it. Go for it. Spring for it, but for. me, it's not going to cost $300.

what is rejection therapy?	When I was six years old, I wrote a letter to my family telling them: "By age 25, I will build the biggest company in the world, and that company will buy Microsoft" I was 30 when I started my own company -- if you want to be Bill Gates, you've got to start sooner or later,, right? This fear even persisted after he started his own company. "Rejection Therapy" is a game invented by Canadian entrepreneur Jason Comely. The idea is for 30 days you go out and look for rejection, and every day get rejected at something, and then by the end, you desensitize yourself from the pain. "I felt, wow, this is like a microcosm of my life. Every Time I felt the slightest rejection, I would just run as fast as possible" Jiaia: Fame and notoriety did not do anything to me. What I really wanted to do was learn, and to change myself. So I turned the rest of my 100 days of rejection into this playground -- into this research project. I wanted to see what I could learn. And Then I learned a lot of things. I discovered so many secrets. For example, I found if I just don't run, if I got rejected, I could actually turn a "no" into a "yes" When I finished teaching that class, I walked out crying, because I thought I could fulfill my life dream just by simply asking.

who invented rejection therapy game	When I was six years old, I wrote a letter to my family telling them: "By age 25, I will build the biggest company in the world, and that company will buy Microsoft" I was 30 when I started my own company -- if you want to be Bill Gates, you've got to start sooner or later,, right? This fear even persisted after he started his own company. "Rejection Therapy" is a game invented by Canadian entrepreneur Jason Comely. The idea is for 30 days you go out and look for rejection, and every day get rejected at something, and then by the end, you desensitize yourself from the pain. "I felt, wow, this is like a microcosm of my life. Every Time I felt the slightest rejection, I would just run as fast as possible" Jiaia: Fame and notoriety did not do anything to me. What I really wanted to do was learn, and to change myself. So I turned the rest of my 100 days of rejection into this playground -- into this research project. I wanted to see what I could learn. And Then I learned a lot of things. I discovered so many secrets. For example, I found if I just don't run, if I got rejected, I could actually turn a "no" into a "yes" When I finished teaching that class, I walked out crying, because I thought I could fulfill my life dream just by simply asking.

how do you build confidence	Elisabeth Buffard: Self-confidence is the most important skill in a soccer coach's life. She explains how to build self-confidence and how to do it with repetition. She says there's no magic button. Repetition, repetition, repetition is the key to building self-confidence. We All have a self-talk tape that plays in our head. We need to reaffirm: "I Am the captain of my ship and the master of my Fate!" How Do you build self-confidence? Get away from the people who will tear you down. There's a difference between hubris, and ego, and false pride. We are critical by the nature of what we do, we are critical of our work. We fix mistakes, instead of praise the positive behaviour that we wanted to reinforce. Self-confident people interpret feedback the way they choose to. We can apply that to the business world, we can apply to our management teams. "She Wouldn't date you unless there was the last person on Earth, hell was freezing over, there was a small chance we had to save the planet Earth" "No one will believe in you unless you do. Listen To the words of that video, here's to the crazy ones, the Misfits, the Rebels, the Troublemakers, the round pegs in the square holes."

how long does it take to play a ukulele	Author Malcolm Gladwell says the 10,000 hour rule is based on studies of expert-level performance. He says the more deliberate practice, the more time individuals spend practicing, the better you get. Gladwell: Practice a lot, well, and you will do extremely well. Dr. Ericsson: It takes 10,000 hours to reach the top of an ultra competitive field in a very narrow subject, that's what that means. But that last statement is not true. People Get good at things with just a little bit of practice. There's a way to practice efficiently, that will make sure that you invest those 20 hours in the most effective way that you possibly can. The first thing about playing the ukulele is, in order to practice, you have to have one, right? You have to get the tools that you are using to practice to practice. The third is to remove barriers to practice. The fourth is to practice for at least 20 hours. The first couple hours are just like the first two hours of anything. I See you, I feel you, that is how I know you go on. 'Cause You were amazing, we did amazing things. Every Night in my dreams (Laughter) I Won't hesitate no more, no more. It cannot wait, I'm yours.

what are the features of iphone 11 pro	Apple's new Iphone 11 Pro is the highest-end phones that Apple makes right now in 2019. Reviewer says the design is not pretty, but it doesn't look horrible in person. The new matte finish and the camera layout are the only really new things back here with the design if it comes to it. The Iphone 11 Pro and Pro Max have even better awesome high resolution Oled displays again, and they're also a bit more efficient, contributing to even more battery gains. The new A13 Bionic chip this year which is excellent and four gigs of ram in these pro phones is still extremely fast as any new phone should be. Thanks to the smaller sensor and slower glass, it is still noticeably a step down. There's now finally, a dedicated night mode, which turns on automatically when it thinks it's dark enough, but sometimes it's kind of dim and it doesn't turn on when you want it to. The Iphone 11 Pro still does the best video of any smartphone. A lot of the features that I was looking forward to especially when we heard it was going to be a pro phone are just not here. The focus for this new Iphone 11 Pro has come down to the battery life and the slightly improved display, and just these new cameras. If you're just someone who wants the best possible camera in your phone, or if you do a lot of video creation, then you'll be really happy with this phone.

why do you use more memory in an apple studio	The Mac Studio is designed to be the ideal computer that is small and powerful enough to be in a studio environment. Apple did use the word modularity in their presentation I Don't know if that word means what they're trying to say because it's not connected to a. own unlike the iMac that's not modular. All of the parts are sold in all parts of the computer. There is no upgrading of the Ram or the. Ram or any parts of this thing ever the entire lifetime of the machine. So there's any reasonable way to actually open up and get into the Mac Studio. The M1 Ultra is literally two M1 Maxes basically fused together with a high enough bandwidth between them to behave like one huge mega chip. That means two times the CPU cores, two times. memory bandwidth, and two times total memory. Apple did send both the M1. and M1 ultra versions here to the studio to test. The M1 Ultra has literally double the media engine of the M1 Max so I thought it would be twice as fast. While they both beat the Mac Pro, it was roughly the same time to export a single Prores clip. Apple says that it'll use over a thousand kilowatt hours less energy per year than an average PC desktop. But at the end of the day, look, this is just a tool. The new Apple Silicon Mac Pro is expected to double performance to double this one up again. But for everyone else, this thing is overkill, and I love that that's the narrative around this computer. Like, do you really need that much power? Probably not, but hey, at least it's a bargain.

difference between pixel 6 and iphone 6 pro	This is the first year we're expecting a real Google flagship, right? So previous pixels have been pretty nice and they've had great cameras and pretty cool software features, but overall pretty lackluster hardware. But reality check, they're not perfect and there's definitely some areas where they come up a little bit short. Both phones are fully water resistant and the haptics are really good on both phones as well. But the biggest new piece Google's adding to these phones is definitely on the inside, and that would be the new Tensor Chip. This is the biggest difference between the benchmarks and what the phone is actually capable of that I've ever seen. New feature in Google Photos for Pixel Six that lets you go back to any picture in your library and erase the things that you don't want. It will auto detect the edges usually really well with any sort of contrast, finds the object you're talking about and just removes it just like that. The battery situation for me has been overall kind of a bummer on the flagship. Pixel 6 has a new camera system featuring a much better hardware suite, a huge 50 megapixel main sensor. There's no high res mode or anything for it, it's always binning and everything is down to 12 and a half megapixels. The more difficult high dynamic range shooting situations are handled great, like shooting directly into the sun or shooting at night. The Pixel 6 and the Pixel 6 Pro are the latest phones with the latest version of the Google phone. The camera has a better overall camera system, but the camera system is better than the pixels right now. The Iphone 6 Pro has a bigger screen, a faster camera and a bigger, faster screen. This is a pivot to, you know from enthusiast phones and really cool cameras and software features to still being the smartest smartphone in the world, but also now having much better hardware, this new design and making their own chip and competing Like really competing, I'm into it. I'm super into it, so that's fun to see.

what's the difference between the samsung s10e and s10e	The Galaxy S10e has the same primary camera and the exact same ultrawide camera as the S10. It's just missing the extra telephoto camera. The fingerprint reader is in the power button on the top right hand side of the phone. The 5.8 inch screen is still weird to call a 58 inch display, but it's still a true and dynamic dynamic dynamic. Ammo Led, still a sharp high resolution, still has a hole punch cut out in the top corner that makes for amazing wallpapers of course, and still super bright and color accurate as you'd expect from a Samsung panel. S10e has the same size side bezels and the chin maybe two or three millimeters taller so that's the aesthetic difference.

who came up with the theory of relativity?	The word "relativity" is a theory by Einstein. It changed a lot of the ideas we have about space, time, light and gravity. Arthur Eddington, the guy who proved the theory, when asked whether - is it true that only three people in the world understand relativity, he said: "I don't know who's the third" Esam started his YouTube channel in 2014, back in his junior year, and it started a very slow start. The growth continued up until 2016, when the channel reached up to 100,000 subscribers. Esam joined a team and thinking: how can we make this show much better? How Can we integrate the techniques of drama, comedy, just like the ones we have seen in a movie like Interstellar, which actually inspired people to think about these subjects?

when did most likely to succeed start	Anak Obeidallah: When his kids were in middle school, he decided to take notes of what schools should do to teach them important life skills. He says the list included things that were skills like inventive problem-solving or communication or teamwork or figuring out complex situations. He also included character traits like determination and perseverance and resourcefulness, being able to stand up to failure, being bold or appreciating the Wonder in nature and human achievement or capabilities. He said he wanted to track things that would jeopardize or impair a kid's prospects in life. Film called Most Likely To Succeed premiered in January at Sundance and has been to more than a dozen major film festivals. Film has been at every Important Education conference. We've had more than 1,000 schools request that film. I'm a believer in the power of film and I found a documentarian that I think is the best in the country to film across the country in all sorts of situations. "Let's educate to our strengths. instead of chasing Shanghai and South Korea on standardized tests, let's change the center of the universe and education from accountability and failed test measures," President Obama says. "Our country is the most innovative and determined on the face of the planet," he says.

how was the ukranian response to russia	This week, Russia launched a new round of missiles against Ukraine. More than 50 missiles largely targeted critical facilities in Kiev the capital city in Ukraine. 80 percent of residents in Kiev were left without water, many homes and businesses were without electricity as well. Three weeks of targeting Ukraine's electricity network is pushing the power grid towards a Tipping Point. You can see a lot of the consequences of human activities from space. You don't control the amount of resources that you have on board, but you have to manage them. If we can make a space station fly, then we can save the planet. We've also worked a lot on all our packaging just like on Earth.

oneplus smartphone screen resolution	Reviewer says the Oneplus 6 is a balanced budget performance beast. Review has become an exercise in a study of the law of diminishing returns. Reviewer: The most important feature of the phone is the price. Oneplus has gone with the glass back, but didn't add wireless charging and then it's not officially water-resistant. The Oneplus 6 has a 1080p optic amoled display 6.3 inches from corner to corner. The resolution 2280 by 1080 is actually hugely beneficial for battery life. The best part of this display is actually the clever way Oneplus has handled the notch up at the top. The display setting lets you hide the notch anytime if you don't want to use it. This is both literally and figuratively the most polished phone One has ever made. For the price, it is definitely better than other 500 phones. The specs are ridiculous. Snapdragon 845 Six or eight gigs of ram. that's knocking out the door of like the highest end flagships we have.

how does stacy smell	Dan and Arin go on to straighten their hair and curl Arin's hair. Dan's hair will now be diffused with the help of the lovely Megan. Arin says she's been in a relationship with Dan for eight years. Dan says he's not taking it seriously and that Stacy said she's a bitch. Arin: "I look like my mom in 1987. I look like a stuffy European character in a Disney cartoon" Lacey: "When You don't get it trimmed, those dead ends keep splitting, like split ends, and they keep getting shorter and shorter and more and more. Tucker don't cut on this" Dan says he looks like the guy from...

So today I'm going to show you how easy it can be to cook with his delicious protein. The teriyaki glaze is the perfect way to sear in that glaze over those duck breasts. The speaker behind that great duck breast okay is leaving it to rest whenever you rest. Don't slice a duck piping hot is going to spoil it and you leave the goodness on the board. Leave the goodness inside the duck. That's almost like a sort of a bit of a Szechuan pepper. All you do is just literally slice that in half and look, you sit that on top. And honestly, I touch a sauce on there and I promise you. Bob's your uncle and Fanny's your auntie and that is a beautiful, delicious duck in 10.

what headphones has the best noise cancellation	Bose Noise Canceling Headphones 700 are a prime example of competition, driving things forward and making better products for us, the consumers. The most striking part is of course, the new, pretty minimal design. But then, pretty much all the new features that they've added are a direct response to all the headphones that have been coming out over the past year that have had cool features that have sort of passed them up. If you're in it for that big thumping bass, you might find these a bit lackluster or disappointing. But if you're buying headphones for noise cancellation, the Bose are back on top. For the money, the Sony might be a little bit of a better buy.

what is the bigger phone	This is the Galaxy Note 10. it's a bit smaller, it's missing a bunch of what the Note 10 Plus has, and it's still 950 bucks and I still kind of like it. It's been a while since I've used a phone that's actually this small. The hole punch cutout, even though it's the same size, appears just a tiny bit bigger. The Note 10 has a smaller battery, but a 1080p display got me those same great numbers for battery about a four hour screen on time, which is pretty good battery life. Galaxy S10 Plus has a bigger, higher resolution display at 6.4 inches and 1440p, same ultrasonic fingerprint sensor, better speakers, and it has basically the same triple cameras on the back, but sideways instead of vertical. For those who liked the note but wanted it to be smaller, this phone is for those people. It's kind of refreshing actually having a flagship phone be smaller even though it's still a 6.3 inch display. But all that being said, uh, I would still go for oneplus 7 Pro over this note and over the S10.

what is a multipotentialite	Ask yourself where you learned to assign the meaning of wrong or abnormal to doing many things. When you were first asked the question, "What do you want to be when you grow up?" goes from being the cute exercise it once was to the thing that keeps us up at night. This is the idea that we have one great thing meant to do during our time on this time. A multipotentialite is someone with many interests and creative pursuits. It was considered the ideal to be well versed in multiple disciplines during the Renaissance period. Multipotentialites with all of their backgrounds are able to access a lot of these points of intersection. They bring everything we've learned to every new area we pursue, so we're rarely starting from scratch. We should all be designing lives and careers that are aligned with how we are wired, and sadly,. multipotentialites are largely being encouraged simply to be more like their specialist peers. Embracing Our inner wiring leads to a happier, more authentic life and perhaps more importantly,. the world needs us.

why do people refuse social media	Computer scientist Cal Calwell says he's never had a social media account. Calwell: "Rejecting social media would be an act of extreme [bloodism]. It would be like riding to work on a horse or using a rotary phone," he says. He says social media is a source of entertainment, it's an entertainment product. It leverages some fundamental technologies, but it's better understood as this.. Social media is not a fundamental technology, it's just a source of entertainment, one among many,. And it's somewhat unsavory if you look a little bit closer. I Hear when I suggest that people quit social media, this objection also is nonsense. In a competitive 21st century economy, what the market values is the ability to produce things that are rare and are valuable. We Know that the constant exposure to your friends, carefully curated, positive portrayals of their life can leave you to feel inadequate, and can increase rates of depression. The Canary in the Coal Mine for this issue is actually college campuses, they'll tell you that along with the rise of ubiquitous smartphone use and social media use among the students on the campus,. came an explosion of anxiety-related disorders on those campuses.

why is my life changing map important to me	The World is changed by our maps of the world. The Way that we choose -- sort of, our personal cartographic enterprise, also shapes the map of our lives, and that in turn shapes our lives. I Believe that what we map changes the life we lead. But I Do believe that while maps don't show you where you will go in your life,. they show you. When I was in tenth grade, I went to a school, Indian Springs School, a small boarding school, outside of Birmingham, Alabama. I found myself in a community of learners. I learned that some infinite sets are bigger than other infinite sets, and Iambic Pentameter is and why it sounds so good to human ears. And Along the way, the map of my life got bigger; it contained more places. The most interesting communities of learners that are growing up on the Internet right now are on YouTube. The Higgs Boson is the last fundamental piece of the standard model of particle physics to be discovered experimentally. It's the last piece in the model for the weak nuclear force that until now, we've been unable to confirm its existence. John Sutter: YouTube is like a classroom to me, and in many ways it's like the old-fashioned classroom. He says YouTube comments have a very bad reputation in the world of the Internet, but in fact, what you'll find is people engaging the subject matter, asking difficult, complicated questions that are about the subject subject, and then other people answering those questions. JG: I believe that these spaces, the kind of communities, have become for a new generation of learners, become kind of learners. As an adult, re-finding these communities has re-introduced me to a community of learners, and has encouraged me to continue to be a learner even in my adulthood. Vi Hart and "Minute Physics" introduced me to all kinds of things that I didn't know before. And I truly believe that when we invented Agloe, New York, in the 1960s, when we made Agloe real, we were just getting started.

He says YouTube comments have a very bad reputation in the world of the Internet, but in fact, what you'll find is people engaging the subject matter, asking difficult, complicated questions that are about the subject subject, and then other people answering those questions.

And I truly believe that when we invented Agloe, New York, in the 1960s, when we made Agloe real, we were just getting started.
which earbuds are made with agricole?	Samsung Galaxy buds Plus are the go-to for wireless earbuds that aren't airpods. Kim PhD: They check all of the fundamental boxes that make them incredibly easy to recommend and enjoy. The buds are built well, they have this sort of a rubber fin around the outside that helps them seat in your ear instead of poking out that can get kind of painful. These are tuned by AKG and they're proud to put their name on it and I can see why. They have a big, rich, full bass, crisp, clean mids and highs, no background hisss. The only complaint I could see coming from a different pair of earbuds is these may actually feel a bit bass heavy if you're not used to all this.

how many people has to go through surgery before one is helped	A few years ago, I broke into my own house, broke through a basement window, and taped it up over the opening, figuring that in the morning, on the way to the airport, I could call my contractor and ask him to fix it. But the next morning, I woke up on too little sleep, worrying about the hole in the window, the freezing temperatures, and the meetings I had upcoming in Europe, my thinking was cloudy, but I didn't know it was cloudy because of my thinking. There's a lot of science in the brain that works on spatial memory, based on our spatial memory. The NNT is the number of people that need to take a drug or undergo a surgery before one person is helped. This stands as a proxy for all kinds of medical decision-making. The number needed to treat for the most widely prescribed Statin, what do you suppose it is? How Many people have to take it before one patient is helped? 300. The most widely performed surgery on men over the age of 50, removal of the prostate for cancer, the number needed to treat is 49. That's right,, 49 surgeries are done for every one person who's helped. The side effects in that case occur in 50 percent of the patients. They include impotence, erectile dysfunction, urinary incontinence, rectal tearing. And If you're lucky, and you're one of the 50 percent who has these,. they'll only last for a year or two.

what is the red mi k20 pro	Red-meat K20 Pro feels like a super complete all-around basically flagship level phone. It has essentially everything for 400 bucks and that's why it's blowing up. It's definitely more expensive than the 300 dollar Polka phone, which is absolutely crazy, but this in this package is definitely a better, more all-round phone. The K20 Pro has yet another flagship looking spec: an array of triple cameras on the back, a 48 megapixel main camera, an 8 megapixel telephoto, and a 13 megapixel ultra wide. It's not the fastest camera in the world, but overall the image quality not bad. The only thing I don't like about this selfie camera is the photos it takes which are straight garbage. Redmi K20 Pro is a great phone for the price red-meat K 20 Pro. It gets you the closest to forgetting that you spent half what you could have spent on a high-end phone. The vibration motor, for example, pretty cheap, pretty loose, not very good, and when you feel that all the time, you're reminded.

what are airpods max	Apple's Airpods Max are the first set of high-end headphones that sound great for music and and podcasts and movies, and and all kinds of consumer oriented features. They are geared for production, and then on the other side, there's just luxury listening. They land squarely in that second section of luxury Listening. Apple went with over-ear headphones here instead of on-ear and I definitely prefer this. The mesh ear cups with memory foam are nice and soft and very comfortable. The ear cups are removable easily with magnets. At least they're easy to replace and you can mix and match colors if you want to. The lack of touch controls were a good call here on the Airpods max. The Sony Xm4s have nine microphones that pick up your voice and cancel out background noise. There's no latency or range issues anywhere with bluetooth, so I'm able to walk around corners and even up and down stairs away from my device without a drop connection. The battery life on these headphones is fine, but this case is so stupid. Apple's Airpods Max headphones are not wired, they're not open back, but they're meant to deliver a great listening experience. With their sweet noise cancellation they do with their pretty cool spatial audio experience. It'll pick up on 7.1 and Dolby Atmos sound sources and will sort of respond to your head placement based on where you're at. The wireless connection? Great for listening.
