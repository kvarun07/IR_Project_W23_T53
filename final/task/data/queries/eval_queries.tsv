And, in rats and mice, one can increase their life span by 30 or 40%. There's evidence that if you restrict the time window that you eat each day to 8 hours or less, it'll have health benefits,. again,, that's long enough to shift the energy metabolism.

what is the screen on xperia 3	The Xperia One Three has a 21x9 aspect ratio and a 4k 120hz display. The phone has stereo front-facing speakers flanking the edges of the phone, and they're nice and loud, louder than the previous generation. Dual Sim card tray at the top removable without a tool and the second card tray doubles as expandable storage for those micro Sd cards up to a terabyte. This is an enthusiast phone and so people who are willing to make that sacrifice to have a nice narrow, taller, better looking display with cinema videos they'll be fine with that couple apps not working. The one thing you can't get around is having a display at 4k 120 Hertz all the time. It eats into battery life pretty hard. There are only two telephoto focal lengths, but there's only one telephoto camera on the back of the phone. Sony won't reveal how they're moving glass inside the phone to give you two different zooms. Even after all that technical wizardry, the photo quality really isn't that great like I'd like to think.

what is the difference between a pixel and a pixel xl phone	The Pixel 4 Xl is one of the phones I was looking forward to the most this entire year for 2019 for a couple of reasons and so now I've been using it daily since it's unveiling. This is my honest review, so let's just start with the way it looks. The worst part about the way this phone looks is the front. Pixel 4 and Pixel 4 Xl have made the jump to smooth high-res high-refresh rate 90 Hertz displays my favorite trend in smartphones of the past year, so it's difficult to show you exactly how much better that looks. The Pixel 4 has a 3 700 milliamp battery that's one of the smallest phones I've seen in a while. The new Pixel 4 has a 12 megapixel primary camera and a new 16 megapixel 2x telephoto camera. It's not the flashiest or most eye-catching or dramatic display on any smartphone, but it's 1440p and flat. The Pixel 4 also has dual cameras on the back of the phone. Iphone 11 Pro vs. Pixel 4 is a toss-up depending on the scenario, but if I could only pick one which is sort of a different question, I would pick Iphone. It has the ultra wide and it absolutely crushes it in video like video is just not as much of a focus with the Pixel 4's camera. Overall, many of the conclusions about Pixel 4 are about how disappointing it is. But this isn't a phone I'm going around recommending to everyone. It still needs a bigger battery, still needs more storage, and it's just generally not complete for most people. The best part of the Pixel again is how refined Android is. If you want the latest version of Android, if you want to be first with updates, the phone to get.	55	281

when does multiplier time management start	Time management is no longer just logical,. Today, time management is emotional, and how our feelings of guilt, and fear, and worry, and frustration, dictate how we choose to spend our time. Time management theory began in the late fifties, and sixties, and it came during the Industrial Revolution, and an early time management thought was all about efficiency. All Prioritizing does, is take item number 7 on your to do list, and it bumps it up to number 1,, which is valuable in and of itself, but it doesn't do anything inherently to create more time. Multipliers realize that next generation time management has much more to do with what you don't do, than what you do do. Rory MacLachlan is married to Rory Vaden, and they have been married for 20 years, ever since. Multipliers give themselves permission to invest, invest the time and energy to automate the process of paying bills. Automation is to your time exactly what compounding interest is. Compounding interest takes money and it makes money into more money. If you can't eliminate, automate, or delegate a task,. That task drops out the bottom of the funnel,. At that point,. there's only one question, and that question is: Should I Do this task now? Must It be done now, or can it wait until later? If The task must be done, then that's what we call "concentrate". It's the permission to protect. It's all about focus, and eliminating distractions.	65	409

what is astroturf	Astroturf is when political, corporate, or other special interests disguise themselves and publish blogs, start Facebook and Twitter accounts, publish ads and post comments online to try to fool you into thinking an independent or grassroots movement is speaking.

what is the largest battery that the rog phone has	The Asus Rog Phone 3 follows closely in a lot of the same footsteps as Rog Phone 2. Similar design and specs and choices just bumped up a notch for 2020. It doesn't have a headphone jack built in on the Rog phone 3. There's also no official Ip dust or water resistance rating and no wireless charging. The phone has a 6,000 milliamp hour battery which is again the biggest battery I've ever used in a phone. This year there's also 30 watt fast charging supported. It's probably a lock for the battery award this year. The best way to transition from big numbers to actual user experience is great software and Asus software. Phone 3 is a beast of a phone, but for the rest of us, these really just end up being glorified or really nice media machines. I'm more confused why there's still a camera bump on the back of the phone at all on maybe the thickest flagship phone of the year.	85	266

what are flagship phones	The Oneplus 8 Pro is a flagship phone that starts at 900 bucks. It's the latest in a long line of phones getting slightly more expensive every year. The new matte finish and blue color are pretty sick, but I think it's one of the absolute better looking phones out there. The camera bump is not as ugly as some of the others out there, it still is pretty big. The Oneplus 8 has a 4 510 milliamp hour battery. It's not the biggest battery in the world, but for me it did just fine. The edges are still curved over both sides and this is my least favorite feature of this display. I realize the idea is it looks cool and it's edgeless and futuristic, but I think it's time to slow that. The Oneplus 8 Pro is a flagship quality camera right in line with Galaxy S20 and Huawei P40 and just short of the pixel and the iphone. It's spitting out sharp 12 megapixel images with nice dynamic range and colors, but get some fringing when your photos are close up subjects. The night mode is pretty good, which is nice, but it's barely passable at 30x. Oneplus phones have long been some of my favorites, specifically because of the software and optimized experience. This is Oxygen Os on top of Android 10, and that's no exception here for this phone. There's tons of little tweaks and optimizations and improvements, and little tightened up animations all over the place, but it never feels overloaded.	90	274

why does not yet give children greater confidence?	The words "yet" or "not yet" give kids greater confidence, give them a path into the future that creates greater persistence. "Not Yet" also gave me insight into a critical event early in my career, a real turning point. I wanted to see how children coped with challenge and difficulty, so I gave 10-year-olds problems that were slightly too hard for them. But other students felt it was tragic, catastrophic, catastrophic.

why did panic monster wake up during a deadline	Tim Urban: In college, I was a government major, which means I had to write a lot of papers. But then came my 90-page senior thesis, a paper you're supposed to spend a year on. So I Planned things out, and I decided I kind of had to go something like this. This is how the year would go. But then those middle months actually went by, and he didn't really write words, and so we were here. And then two months turned into one month, which turned into two weeks. And one day I woke up with three days until the deadline, still not having written a word. I thought that was the end of everything. But The Instant Gratification Monkey only cares about two things: easy and fun. To the Monkey, humans are just another animal species. Sometimes, it makes sense to be doing things that are harder and less pleasant, for the sake of the big picture. The Panic Monster is dormant most of the time, but wakes up anytime a deadline gets too close. The Panic Monster explains all kinds of pretty insane procrastinator behavior, like how someone like me could spend two weeks unable to start the opening sentence of a paper, and then miraculously find the unbelievable work ethic to stay up all night and write eight pages. This is what I decided to write about on the blog a couple of years ago. Thousands of emails came in, from all different kinds of people from all over the world.	135	328

And one day I woke up with three days until the deadline, still not having written a word. I thought that was the end of everything. But The Instant Gratification Monkey only cares about two things: easy and fun. To the Monkey, humans are just another animal species. Sometimes, it makes sense to be doing things that are harder and less pleasant, for the sake of the big picture. The Panic Monster is dormant most of the time, but wakes up anytime a deadline gets too close. The Panic Monster explains all kinds of pretty insane procrastinator behavior, like how someone like me could spend two weeks unable to start the opening sentence of a paper, and then miraculously find the unbelievable work ethic to stay up all night and write eight pages. This is what I decided to write about on the blog a couple of years ago. Thousands of emails came in, from all different kinds of people from all over the world.	138	328

what is the root cause of distraction?	A few years ago, I began to observe something in my own behavior that made me a bit uncomfortable. I decided to, essentially,, for all intents and purposes,, get rid of the thing for a month. After looking at the research, this is what I've come to know as a symptom for the deeper problem, which runs much more deeply - it's the root cause of this distraction. We're at this hyperstimulated state where we bounce around between objects of attention that are very, very stimulating for our mind. So I thought, "Okay, if the phone had this impact on my attention span,. what if I lowered how stimulated I was even more, still?" So, I asked readers of my website to make themselves bored for an hour a day, for a month. We need to make two fundamental shifts with regard to how we think about our attention. This is when our best ideas and plans come to us. We need more space. We like to think of distraction as the enemy of focus. It is a symptom of why we find it difficult to focus, which is the fact that our mind is overstimulated. When we become less stimulated, when we make our mind more calm, we get the benefits of added productivity and focus and ideas and creativity, but we also live a better life because of it. Thank You so much. (Applause) Thank You for your comments.	170	321

So, I asked readers of my website to make themselves bored for an hour a day, for a month. We need to make two fundamental shifts with regard to how we think about our attention. This is when our best ideas and plans come to us. We need more space. We like to think of distraction as the enemy of focus. It is a symptom of why we find it difficult to focus, which is the fact that our mind is overstimulated. When we become less stimulated, when we make our mind more calm, we get the benefits of added productivity and focus and ideas and creativity, but we also live a better life because of it. Thank You so much. (Applause) Thank You for your comments.	172	321
why do we need distraction	A few years ago, I began to observe something in my own behavior that made me a bit uncomfortable. I decided to, essentially,, for all intents and purposes,, get rid of the thing for a month. After looking at the research, this is what I've come to know as a symptom for the deeper problem, which runs much more deeply - it's the root cause of this distraction.

what is the term used to describe the psychology of social relationships?	When I was seven years old and my sister was just five years old,. we were playing on top of a bunk bed. We stumbled across something called positive psychology, which is the reason that I wake up every morning. What we found is -- (Laughter) If I Got this data studying you, I would be thrilled, because there's a trend there, and that means that I can get published. Positive Psychology posits that if we study what is merely average, we will remain merely average. If You fall below the average, then psychologists get thrilled, because that means you're depressed or have a disorder. But If I'm interested in your potential, or for happiness, we're creating the cult of the average with science. Only 25% of job successes are predicted by IQ, 75% predicted by optimism levels, your social support and your ability to see stress as a challenge instead of a threat. Your Brain at Positive is 31% more productive than your brain at negative, neutral or stressed. We need to reverse the formula for happiness and success. By doing these activities and by training your brain just like we train our bodies,. what we've found is we can reverse the formula for happiness and success,. And in doing so, not only create ripples of positivity, but a real revolution. (applause)	175	374

what is the display resolution on oneplus?	Reviewer says the Oneplus 6 is a balanced budget performance beast. Review has become an exercise in a study of the law of diminishing returns. Reviewer: The most important feature of the phone is the price. Oneplus has gone with the glass back, but didn't add wireless charging and then it's not officially water-resistant. The Oneplus 6 has a 1080p optic amoled display 6.3 inches from corner to corner. The resolution 2280 by 1080 is actually hugely beneficial for battery life. The best part of this display is actually the clever way Oneplus has handled the notch up at the top. The display setting lets you hide the notch anytime if you don't want to use it. This is both literally and figuratively the most polished phone One has ever made. For the price, it is definitely better than other 500 phones. The specs are ridiculous. Snapdragon 845 Six or eight gigs of ram. that's knocking out the door of like the highest end flagships we have.	190	310

is it easier to be quick and slow to finish	John Sutter: I've been studying people that I come to call "originals" Originals are nonconformists, people who not only have new ideas, but take action to champion them. Sutter says people who rush in and do everything early are less creative than people who procrastinate. He says procrastination gives you time to consider divergent ideas, think in nonlinear ways. A lot of great originals are quick to start, but they're slow to finish, says John Sutter. Sutter: To be original, you don't have to be first, you just need to be different and better. He says Leonardo da Vinci toiled on and off for 16 years on the Mona. Lisa, Martin Luther King Jr. Delayed the task of finalizing the speech until the very last minute. The Four browser groups, on average have similar typing speed, and they also have similar levels of computer knowledge. It's not a technical advantage, but it's about how you got the browser. If you wanted Firefox or Chrome, you had to doubt the default and look for a better option. Know that being quick to start, but slow to finish can boost your creativity, that you can motivate yourself by doubting your ideas and embracing the fear of failing to try. Look, being original is not easy, but I Have no doubt about this: it's the best way to improve the world around us.. Thank you.	200	343

Know that being quick to start, but slow to finish can boost your creativity, that you can motivate yourself by doubting your ideas and embracing the fear of failing to try. Look, being original is not easy, but I Have no doubt about this: it's the best way to improve the world around us.. Thank you.	203	343
who said being unique is quicker to start or slow to finish?	John Sutter: I've been studying people that I come to call "originals" Originals are nonconformists, people who not only have new ideas, but take action to champion them. Sutter says people who rush in and do everything early are less creative than people who procrastinate. He says procrastination gives you time to consider divergent ideas, think in nonlinear ways. A lot of great originals are quick to start, but they're slow to finish, says John Sutter. Sutter: To be original, you don't have to be first, you just need to be different and better. He says Leonardo da Vinci toiled on and off for 16 years on the Mona. Lisa, Martin Luther King Jr. Delayed the task of finalizing the speech until the very last minute.

what is the new chip apple watch	The Red Apple Watch Series 6 has been wearing it every day since the Impressions video now, so been living with it. There's really not a whole ton of massively new stuff as you already knew. But a lot of the stuff that makes the Apple watch the Apple Watch and so good is of course in the software watchos that's gonna make its way to other Apple watches. The real best feature of the Apple Watch Series 6 is just the new S6 chip inside that's what's giving you the great efficiency to last all day. If you disable the oezon display, you'll probably get even better battery life and then it's enabling the faster charging. The new solo loop bands are a great idea and I love the simplicity to put it on, no velcro or buck magnets or buckles. The new Apple Watch Se has the new S6 chip but there's no electrocardiogram and no blood oxygen sensor. It's a much lower price and that's fine for most people getting their first Apple watch. Most people don't even need this newest version with all the bells and whistles and extra sensors.	210	259

what is the z flip	The Z Flip 3 is a foldable phone that folds in half and folds into a smaller form factor. The new design is pretty sweet, the much improved build quality, and the bigger, much more usable outside cover screen. It's a 6.7 inch display with a 22.9x 1080p punch out and 120 Hertz out. The outside screen on the flip 3 is four times the area of the last one and it genuinely changes the way you use the phone. The crease is definitely still here. The keyboard is below it doesn't touch it, so all that's fine, but on the other hand, it's definitely still noticeable even if you're just a little bit off axis. You get decent selfie image quality from the primary cameras which aren't quite Flagship level, but they're pretty good. It delivers on the One Promise of being able to fold your phone down into something that's theoretically a bit more pocketable for people with smaller Pockets. The tiny X6 offers up to four terabytes of storage at 800 megabytes per second.	230	242

what is the difference between a beats beats headphones and a beats phone	These are my favorite build of Beats headphones actually of all time, but I also think that that biggest improvement may have also led to this headphones biggest downside, which is comfort. They turn on automatically when you open them, and they turn off automatically right when you close them. Transparency mode and the noise cancellation is pretty good like better than I expected. It's great with background noise, great with public transit and awesome on a plane. The transparency mode, which uses the microphones to let you hear what's around you instead of cancelling that sound works very well. The soft case they come in? it's just that it's a soft case. So I'll say that's fine for me because I keep them in a backpack and a compartment by themselves. The only bummer is that they charge via lightning.	245	280

what is the phone oneplus	The Oneplus 7 is just like the Oneplus 6t, but refreshed for this year. It has a teardrop notch instead of the pop-up camera. It drops the ultra wide and it's just the standard camera and the telephoto. The front speaker grille and the speaker itself are a little bit bigger. This phone is so under the radar because that's where Oneplus put it. Oneplus is actively moving their brand positioning from straight up budget to much more premium. The competition is putting it there. There has never been more competition at this sort of premium, mid-tier price than there is right now.	265	293

who said capitalism is a form of psychopathy?	Morton Bast meets a Scientologist who says psychiatry is a pseudo-science that can't be trusted. He meets a man who faked madness to get out of a prison sentence. He met him at Broadmoor Hospital, where he met the patients. He says he has 12 mental disorders, including nightmares, anxiety and malingering. Psychiatrist: "There's been a terrible misunderstanding. I'm not mentally ill" Psychologist: "Faking madness is exactly the kind of cunning and manipulative act of a psychopath.. It's on the checklist: cunning, manipulative" Psychopath: glibness, superficial charm, grandiose sense of self-worth and lack of empathy.

who fakes madness	Morton Bast meets a Scientologist who says psychiatry is a pseudo-science that can't be trusted. He meets a man who faked madness to get out of a prison sentence. He met him at Broadmoor Hospital, where he met the patients. He says he has 12 mental disorders, including nightmares, anxiety and malingering. Psychiatrist: "There's been a terrible misunderstanding. I'm not mentally ill" Psychologist: "Faking madness is exactly the kind of cunning and manipulative act of a psychopath.. It's on the checklist: cunning, manipulative" Psychopath: glibness, superficial charm, grandiose sense of self-worth and lack of empathy.

what foldable is the best phone	The Galaxy Fold 2 5g is the only phone that I can actually recommend any group of people actually buy. It's still expensive, it's still got its compromises, but this is the best one. The main display here on the fold 2 is pretty much all win, and this is what makes the Galaxy Fold so fun to use and such a king. The Galaxy Z Fold 2 is the best folding phone in a lot of ways. It's got the best specs of any foldable that's for sure Snapdragon 865, plus 12 gigs of ram. It's the only one I think with wireless charging other than the Z-flip. It also has the best speakers I've heard in a foldable. Even though this is the best folding phone, it's also still super obvious that this is nowhere near the end of the line. The outside screen is still slightly worse than a normal smartphone because it's it's suit, tall and narrow and chunky to hold. And number two. it's still expensive for that price.	280	260

what is the definition of the j-shaped spine	When I was 15, I wanted to be a bodybuilder. I was scouted in the street and was forced to give up on my bodybuilding dream. Fitness industry prioritizes muscles before focusing on how they are moving their body. Fitness talks focus on how gymnasts move their body, not on how their muscles move. As humans, we were born with full range of motion. Biochemist Esther Gokhale found people's spines with a flatter lumbar curvature didn't suffer from back pain in places where back pain hardly exists. We're all born with a J-shaped spine, and this is what you see in Greek statues and in young children universally. In Cultures where the J-shaped spine exists, people's butt muscles engage every time they take a step. It's one reason they have these strong butt muscles that support their lower back. We Didn't focus on these muscles, we focused on a movement. Focus On a movement; muscles follow suit. We move efficiently. The body recruits the right muscles for the job.	285	404

how much battery life for a toshiba 11	This phone has a Snapdragon 8, Gen 2 with 8 gigs of RAM, a 6.7 inch 1440p, 120 Hertz OLED display, triple cameras and a 5 000 milliamp hour battery with 80 watt charging for 699 bucks. The Hasselblad branding is back and we'll talk about the cameras in a minute. The OnePlus 11 has a 5,000 milliamp hour battery. It has 80 watt charging in the US and other versions have 100 watt charging. The only reason I'm not going to keep dailying this phone though aside from other phones that I have to test very soon, is the software. On this phone, it's a swipe, a tap, and another tap to get to the app. It takes multiple swipes to get through all your notifications and close them every time. That's a little more annoying over time. But the good thing is other than that, there's a lot of nice things like in this software. it's very well thought out and laid out. I think if OnePlus really wants to sort of redeem themselves and they look back a little bit at what was so successful with oxygen OS. I Know they eventually did this merge thing with Oppo and color OS.	290	211

which ipad is better for desk or desk	The new 10th Generation Baseline iPad has a new design, a slightly larger 11 inch LCD screen up front, landscape stereo speakers, a bump from an 8 to a 12 megapixel camera on the back and an A14 bionic chip inside. Apple also announced that this iPad will support the first generation Apple pencil which infamously plugged into the bottom of the old iPads to charge via that lightning Port. The two-piece setup has its benefits and drawbacks. The main drawback really being that it's not as laughable as it's more suited for working on desk or a more stable surface because of the weight distribution. The biggest head scratcher of them all has got to be the prices, right?	295	216

how smart is the apple watch	Mkbhd: Series four is the first real redesign of the Apple Watch, and it's massively better in a lot of ways. It comes in two new sizes, the previous small 38 millimeter has turned into a 40 mil. The sensor array on the back, even they don't necessarily look at it that much, is now ceramic. The new watch has a bigger screen and a new design. Launch Siri is noticeably faster and getting responses from Siri is snappy. Fall detection and Ekgs can detect irregular heart rhythm. There is no sleep tracking at all, which you would think would be kind of a big deal in a watch that's so focused on health and fitness. If Apple opened this up to developers and had an app store for watch faces, it could be huge, right? You still can't use any assistant other than Siri, but if I could switch it to Google Assistant, I would be so happy. At the end of the day this is the best smart watch by far all over again and obviously the one to get if you have an iphone.	300	306

what's the name of the new wayfinder apple watch ultra	The Apple Watch Ultra is an 800 watch that has some extra premium features and specs that are amazing and definitely overkill for most people. It's attractive for the most extreme users, the adventurers who go on serious hikes or go diving or run marathons or do triathlons. The Apple Watch Ultra has added that Wr-100 water resistance rating for submersion up to a hundred meters, the new 2000 nits max brightness for this display, which means it's the most visible outdoors that I've seen a Smartwatch Oled. The Action Button can be mapped to right now any one of these eight things. So I really like having it. I did feel like I accidentally pressed it a lot. The new Watch Ultras got the dual frequency Gps which is huge and the action button is nice too. But the significantly improved battery life is huge for extreme endurance athletes. The new wayfinder watch face by default puts all the stuff right at your fingertips, including a live compass that's super smooth. The Apple Watch Ultra has the longest battery life, the biggest brightest display, the best microphones and speakers, and it's all in this most accurate tracking package yet. It's kind of put itself in this unique category where it's replacing some of these extreme like dive computers or Gps watches that you'd normally take off when you're done with your workout.	310	220

what is the difference between mac studio and mac pro	The Mac Studio is designed to be the ideal computer that is small and powerful enough to be in a studio environment. Apple did use the word modularity in their presentation I Don't know if that word means what they're trying to say because it's not connected to a. own unlike the iMac that's not modular. All of the parts are sold in all parts of the computer. There is no upgrading of the Ram or the. Ram or any parts of this thing ever the entire lifetime of the machine. So there's any reasonable way to actually open up and get into the Mac Studio. The M1 Ultra is literally two M1 Maxes basically fused together with a high enough bandwidth between them to behave like one huge mega chip. That means two times the CPU cores, two times. memory bandwidth, and two times total memory. Apple did send both the M1. and M1 ultra versions here to the studio to test. The M1 Ultra has literally double the media engine of the M1 Max so I thought it would be twice as fast. While they both beat the Mac Pro, it was roughly the same time to export a single Prores clip. Apple says that it'll use over a thousand kilowatt hours less energy per year than an average PC desktop. But at the end of the day, look, this is just a tool. The new Apple Silicon Mac Pro is expected to double performance to double this one up again. But for everyone else, this thing is overkill, and I love that that's the narrative around this computer. Like, do you really need that much power? Probably not, but hey, at least it's a bargain.	315	231

what we need to teach girls in school	In 2012, I ran for Congress, the first time in my entire life that I had done something that was truly brave, where I didn't worry about being perfect. Most girls are taught to avoid risk and failure. Boys, on the other hand, are told to play rough, swing high, crawl to the top of the monkey bars, and then jump off headfirst. The bravery deficit is why women are underrepresented in STEM, in C-suites, in boardrooms,. in Congress, and pretty much everywhere you look. Reshma Saujani: In 2012, we'll teach 40,000 girls in 50 states. We have to undo the socialization of perfection, but we've got to combine it with building a sisterhood that lets girls know that they are not alone. When We teach girls to be brave and we have a supportive network cheering them on,. They will build incredible things, she says. We need every tech company to embed a Girls Who Code classroom in their office. We have about 80 partners, from Twitter to Facebook to Adobe to IBM to Microsoft to Pixar to Disney, I mean, every single company out there. I Think that it's crazy to me to think about the fact that right now, 85 percent of all consumer purchases are made by women.	365	387

which oneplus phone has a macro camera	Kphd dropped his first Impressions video with all the specs and all the official stuff about a week ago. This is the full review of the Oneplus Nord phone. The phone has a 1080p, 90 Hertz Oled display and a quad camera system on the back. The Nord has a 2 megapixel macro camera on the back of this phone is just unnecessary because it is so bad and I think even Oneplus would know right away. It's basically to increase the count of the cameras on the phone and it's not actually here to be a great quality camera. Oneplus right now doesn't quite have the brand clout to compete at over a thousand bucks. Oneplus Nord is easy to recommend and easy to consider, but now I'm looking forward to the rest of what the Nord range will bring. I think inevitably, there's a version of this that comes to the Us and I'll be excited waiting for that. If you're shopping for a phone anywhere under 500 bucks or 500 Euros or 30 000 rupees, this is something to look at.	370	265

how much is a oneplus	Oneplus 8 starts at 6.99 and it has the bleeding edge high-end specs you'd want for fast performance. But there are a few things here cut down to save cost and I'll compare this a lot to the oneplus 8 Pro. This phone has a 4300 milliamp hour battery, and it's been impressively good on battery life. The Oneplus 8 has a 48 megapixel main sensor and a 16 megapixel ultrawide camera and a dedicated 2 megapixel macro. It's one of those phones that looks better on camera and in promos than it does in real life. The camera quality is a step down from flagship quality and sharpness and detail and in colors. Oneplus 8.99 is one of the favorites in this awkward middle child price point of 6.99 to start. You could get if you wanted a smaller phone, you could get Galaxy S10e or Pocophone X2. Or if you absolutely had the best camera quality, you should go for Pixel 3a or the new iphone Se plus Airpods Pro.	375	273

how many people are self aware	People who are self-aware are less likely to lie, cheat, and steal, Williams says. Self-awareness is the ability to see ourselves clearly, to understand who we are, how others see us and how we fit into the world. Williams: 95% of people think they're self aware, but the real number is closer to 15%. Asking "Why?" is the most common introspective question: Why? We might be searching for the cause of a bad mood, or questioning our beliefs. We end up inventing answers that feel true, but are often very wrong. We like to think of our brains as supercomputers, rationally analyzing information and arriving at accurate conclusions. Instead of asking, "Why do I feel so terrible?" he asked, "What's most important to me?" This helped her define what she wanted her life to look like in whatever time she had left. Jose, an entertainment industry veteran, hated his job. Sarah, an education leader, was diagnosed with breast cancer in her late 40s. Jose realized that he would never be happy in this job, and it gave him the courage to pursue a new career path as a wealth manager.	380	331

what is the newest ipad	The new 2021 Ipad Mini has a new 12 megapixel camera on the back. It's an Lcd again, still 60 hertz, same pixel density as last year, same 500 nits max brightness as the last generation. The 8.3 inch display is bigger than the Galaxy Z Fold 3 Unfolded, but it's not an amazing quality display. It has cellular antenna lines, so it is a cellular model that now supports 5g. The new Ipad Mini is running on Apple's absolute latest chip, the A15 with the five core Gpu, which is actually better than what's in the Ipad Air right now. The new 9th gen Baseline Ipad might actually be better for that because it's 170 bucks cheaper and has a bigger screen. But of course it's a different type of tablet and if you're after the mini, it's pretty good. At this price, what are you cross-shopping it with? You could be looking at a surface Go. Or maybe you're looking at like the new, uh, Kindle that just came out with wireless charging. It's the most versatile of the bunch. Definitely worth a look.	385	241

which is stronger belief or intuition?	Ken Hired as Chief Creative Chief Creative Officer in New York and London. Hired a consulting company as you often do to confuse you with facts and facts. Took the job eight months later and decided to create the kind of company we both dreamed of working on. He says energy is like discovering your passion, listening to it, exploring it. For me, it's three things: Trust, intuition, and belief. Trust is the basis in every human relationship and single-handedly the most powerful force of positive energy. Intuition is usually more right than wrong, though we love to convince ourselves otherwise. How do companies and communities in this day and age keep pace with as fast as societies changing? The more technologically advanced society becomes, Maybe maybe the more we need to go back to the basic fundamentals of human communication because you are the content. I call it creative Wisdom and this is when energy takes on its greatest, most transformative power. I've had the honor and the privilege to experience the awesome power of human energy.	415	376

can childhood trauma lead to cancer	Dr. Michael Burke: Exposure to childhood trauma can lead to higher risk of heart disease, lung cancer. He says doctors today are not trained in routine screening or treatment. Burke: Adverse Childhood Experiences Study is something that everybody needs to know about. Burke says doctors should be trained in screening and treatment of childhood trauma. A person with ACE score of seven or more had triple the lifetime risk of lung cancer and three and a half times the risk of ischemic heart disease. Even if you don't engage in any high-risk behavior, you're still more likely to develop heart disease or cancer. High Doses of adversity not only affect brain structure and function,, they affect the developing immune system, developing hormonal systems,. and even the way our DNA is read and transcribed.. At first I thought that we marginalized the issue because it doesn't apply to us. That's an issue for those kids in those neighborhoods. But then, the more I talked to folks, I'm beginning to think that maybe I had it completely backwards. Maybe It's easier to see in other zip codes because we don't want to look at it. We'd rather be sick. Fortunately, scientific advances and, frankly, economic realities make that option less viable every day.	425	325

what is the ukulele practice time	Author Malcolm Gladwell says the 10,000 hour rule is based on studies of expert-level performance. He says the more deliberate practice, the more time individuals spend practicing, the better you get. Gladwell: Practice a lot, well, and you will do extremely well. Dr. Ericsson: It takes 10,000 hours to reach the top of an ultra competitive field in a very narrow subject, that's what that means. But that last statement is not true. People Get good at things with just a little bit of practice. There's a way to practice efficiently, that will make sure that you invest those 20 hours in the most effective way that you possibly can. The first thing about playing the ukulele is, in order to practice, you have to have one, right? You have to get the tools that you are using to practice to practice. The third is to remove barriers to practice. The fourth is to practice for at least 20 hours. The first couple hours are just like the first two hours of anything. I See you, I feel you, that is how I know you go on. 'Cause You were amazing, we did amazing things. Every Night in my dreams (Laughter) I Won't hesitate no more, no more. It cannot wait, I'm yours. If I could, then I would, I'd go wherever you will.	430	323

The only variables that could have come up as a surprise potentially would be battery or cameras. Google's smartest features are all here, like assistant call screening is awesome, live translate, and the sorcery that is basically instant speech to text everywhere in this phone. The Pixel 6a turns out is really all about the Google software experience and the camera. For the price, that's where it excels. And while good phones aren't getting cheap cheap phones are still very much getting good. If you're shopping around, keep your eyes open because there's a bunch of good stuff.	435	225

what is the internet community	The World is changed by our maps of the world. The Way that we choose -- sort of, our personal cartographic enterprise, also shapes the map of our lives, and that in turn shapes our lives. I Believe that what we map changes the life we lead. But I Do believe that while maps don't show you where you will go in your life,. they show you. When I was in tenth grade, I went to a school, Indian Springs School, a small boarding school, outside of Birmingham, Alabama. I found myself in a community of learners. I learned that some infinite sets are bigger than other infinite sets, and Iambic Pentameter is and why it sounds so good to human ears. And Along the way, the map of my life got bigger; it contained more places. The most interesting communities of learners that are growing up on the Internet right now are on YouTube. The Higgs Boson is the last fundamental piece of the standard model of particle physics to be discovered experimentally. It's the last piece in the model for the weak nuclear force that until now, we've been unable to confirm its existence. John Sutter: YouTube is like a classroom to me, and in many ways it's like the old-fashioned classroom. He says YouTube comments have a very bad reputation in the world of the Internet, but in fact, what you'll find is people engaging the subject matter, asking difficult, complicated questions that are about the subject subject, and then other people answering those questions. JG: I believe that these spaces, the kind of communities, have become for a new generation of learners, become kind of learners. As an adult, re-finding these communities has re-introduced me to a community of learners, and has encouraged me to continue to be a learner even in my adulthood. Vi Hart and "Minute Physics" introduced me to all kinds of things that I didn't know before. And I truly believe that when we invented Agloe, New York, in the 1960s, when we made Agloe real, we were just getting started.	440	414

The Way that we choose -- sort of, our personal cartographic enterprise, also shapes the map of our lives, and that in turn shapes our lives. I Believe that what we map changes the life we lead. But I Do believe that while maps don't show you where you will go in your life,. they show you. When I was in tenth grade, I went to a school, Indian Springs School, a small boarding school, outside of Birmingham, Alabama. I found myself in a community of learners. I learned that some infinite sets are bigger than other infinite sets, and Iambic Pentameter is and why it sounds so good to human ears. And Along the way, the map of my life got bigger; it contained more places. The most interesting communities of learners that are growing up on the Internet right now are on YouTube. The Higgs Boson is the last fundamental piece of the standard model of particle physics to be discovered experimentally. It's the last piece in the model for the weak nuclear force that until now, we've been unable to confirm its existence. John Sutter: YouTube is like a classroom to me, and in many ways it's like the old-fashioned classroom. He says YouTube comments have a very bad reputation in the world of the Internet, but in fact, what you'll find is people engaging the subject matter, asking difficult, complicated questions that are about the subject subject, and then other people answering those questions. JG: I believe that these spaces, the kind of communities, have become for a new generation of learners, become kind of learners. As an adult, re-finding these communities has re-introduced me to a community of learners, and has encouraged me to continue to be a learner even in my adulthood. Vi Hart and "Minute Physics" introduced me to all kinds of things that I didn't know before. And I truly believe that when we invented Agloe, New York, in the 1960s, when we made Agloe real, we were just getting started.	444	414

how much do pixel buds cost on amazon	The Pixel Buds A series the cheapest ones right now cost 69.99. But the old retired 2020 pixel buds before they stopped being sold were 179 dollars and I really like them. Maybe later, they'll do a some Next-gen or a more premium Pixel Bud's Pro and they'll be 279 dollars. And actually, if you're cool with any color other than coral, they're literally already on sale on Amazon for less than the price. The Pixel Buds Pro have a much stronger bass than the last pair of earbuds. They also have a slightly lower overall volume than any other buds I've tested in a while. Google Assistant everywhere is great and in the app in the settings, you can customize what a tap and hold on each side does. They have in-ear detection to automatically play and pause when you take them out and put them back in. They even have this ear tip seal check feature which analyzes how well the microphones are actually canceling out sound for you and if it's not working so well, it can recommend a different size ear tip to improve the seal.	455	223

what is the ipad pro like	The new iPad Pro is 5.9 millimeters completely flat. It has an incredible nearly bezel as display somehow has huge, really impressive speakers and super powerful solid-state insides. It stands up on its own and it's so light. The camera on the back is the same as the iPhone, 10 s and 10 are. The new iPad pro is the fastest chip I've ever seen in a mobile device. The new Apple pencil is way better than a number two pencil. There's no trackpad or mouse support at all, so you can plug in any keyboard or mouse. The most Apple and 2018 thing ever though is all the price hikes. There's virtually nothing really new that I can do with the USBC port on the iPad pro that I couldn't already do with a lightning adapter. The closest I can get to my ideal scenario at least with creative stuff on iPad pro is photo editing. I've seen people who's who's.'s creative workflows happen to fit this iPad Pro into the puzzle of what they do perfectly.	460	301

why is it hard to love an addict	It's now exactly 100 years since drugs were first banned in the U.S. and Britain, and we then imposed that on the rest of the world. I was looking at some of the addicts in my life who I love, and trying to figure out if there was some way to help them. I realized there were loads of incredibly basic questions I just didn't know the answer to, like, what really causes addiction. And I realized that really blew my mind is, almost everything we think we know about addiction is wrong. I think we're going to have to change a lot more than our drug policies. In the '70s, Professor Alexander built a cage that he called "Rat Park," which is basically heaven for rats. But in Rat Park, they don't like the drug water, they almost never use it compulsively. None of them ever overdose. You go from almost 100 percent overdose to zero percent overdose when they have happy and connected lives. In 2000, Portugal had one of the worst drug problems in Europe, one percent of the population was addicted to heroin. They punished people and stigmatized them and shamed them more, and every year, the problem got worse. A massive program of job creation for addicts, and microloans for addicts to set up small businesses. The goal was to make sure that every addict in Portugal had something to get out of bed for in the morning. "It's hard loving an addict, and there's going to be lots of people who know in this room. You are angry a lot of the time, and I think one of the reasons why this debate is so charged is because it runs through the heart of each of us,, right? Everyone has a bit of them that looks at an addict and thinks, I wish someone would just stop you. And I think the core of that message -- you're not alone, we love you -- has to be at every level of how we respond to addicts, socially, politically and individually.

In the '70s, Professor Alexander built a cage that he called "Rat Park," which is basically heaven for rats. But in Rat Park, they don't like the drug water, they almost never use it compulsively. None of them ever overdose. You go from almost 100 percent overdose to zero percent overdose when they have happy and connected lives. In 2000, Portugal had one of the worst drug problems in Europe, one percent of the population was addicted to heroin. They punished people and stigmatized them and shamed them more, and every year, the problem got worse. A massive program of job creation for addicts, and microloans for addicts to set up small businesses. The goal was to make sure that every addict in Portugal had something to get out of bed for in the morning. "It's hard loving an addict, and there's going to be lots of people who know in this room. You are angry a lot of the time, and I think one of the reasons why this debate is so charged is because it runs through the heart of each of us,, right? Everyone has a bit of them that looks at an addict and thinks, I wish someone would just stop you. And I think the core of that message -- you're not alone, we love you -- has to be at every level of how we respond to addicts, socially, politically and individually. For 100 years now, we've been singing war songs about addicts. I Think all along we should have	473	324
why did portugal stop using heroin	It's now exactly 100 years since drugs were first banned in the U.S. and Britain, and we then imposed that on the rest of the world. I was looking at some of the addicts in my life who I love, and trying to figure out if there was some way to help them. I realized there were loads of incredibly basic questions I just didn't know the answer to, like, what really causes addiction.

what is oneplus 7t	The Oneplus 7t is a great phone for the price, which is basically the one plus special. It has a 6.55 inch oled screen, 1080p not 1440 and the bezels are just a little bit thicker a tiny bit as you can see. The alert slider is tighter, so it's more satisfying to move between the three positions, so that's pretty sweet. The Oneplus 7t has the same 48 megapixel standard camera, same 117 degree ultra wide, and then a shorter 2x telephoto zoom camera instead of a 3x. The camera circle on the back is the first design from Oneplus that doesn't feel to me like really sleek or clean like they've done triple cameras before but this one is very different. The Warp Charge 30t they say will get you to 70 from dead in half an hour. The Oneplus 7 Pro is still a better phone than this just because of the small bit of trade-offs. Overall, this is that incremental update you expect from a T-phone from Oneplus with the x factor of that 90hz display that is so hard to switch back from. I'm glad that Oneplus is doubling down on the high refresh rate stuff to really make phones feel smooth.	475	285

what energy is used for power	A deadly fire in Xinjiang killed 10 people and injured nine more on Thursday. Protests have erupted all across the country, citizens taking to the streets in an unprecedented challenge to Chinese president XI Jinping's zero coveted policy. A new tech startup wants to replace fossil fuels with concentrated sunlight to power more than just your home. Solar power is a renewable energy resource that's been around for decades to generate power, but with mixed success. Heliogen's process solves this problem by storing its heat and making green fuel like hydrogen that can be used to fuel electric generating stations. Company has major backers like Bill Gates but still, Heliojin has faced obstacles.	490	51

Dr Sanjay Gupta gives us some tips on how to find our happy place amid the cold and winter. Jakarta is sinking into the ocean at alarming rates due to excessive groundwater extraction. The government of Indonesia has a plan to build a new capital city called Nusuntara out of the dense jungles of Eastern Borneo at an estimated cost of more than 30 billion dollars. New Centaura is expected to be completed in 2045 and the government says it will be three and a half times the size of Singapore.	495	31
