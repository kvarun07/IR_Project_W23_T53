Friday Eve It's Thursday March 2nd I'm Coy Wire and we are so grateful that you're spending part of your day with us right here on CNN 10. Let's start today with the latest reporting on the origins of Covet 19. it's been nearly three years since the pandemic began, and we're still trying to figure out answers about how exactly this virus was able to infect so many people and take so many lives. Reporting this week states that with quote low confidence, the U.S Department of Energy and the Director of the FBI endorse a lab leak theory meaning the virus accidentally escaped from a lab in Wuhan China Low confidence according to the office of the Director of National Intelligence generally means that the information is scant, questionable, or very fragmented, or that the intelligence Community has significant concerns about the sources. One of the main reasons that there is so much uncertainty about the virus's origins is that China has not been transparent and willing to to communicate openly with their knowledge and information. Now, others within the U.S Intelligence community and many scientists maintain, however, that this virus developed naturally in animals and then started to spread to humans in an outbreak at a market. Republicans In the House of Representatives on a coveted subcommittee are committed to investigating the issue and finding the origin of the virus. Here's CNN Chief Investigative Correspondent: Pamela Brown With more more than three years after the start of the Covid-19 Pandemic, the theory that the virus originated from a lab in Wuhan China in the spotlight, the Department of Energy now saying in an updated classified report that it believes with low confidence that the virus accidentally escaped from a lab, but that theory remains a minority opinion within the U.S Intelligence Community Some elements of the Intelligence Community have reached conclusions on one side, some on the other. A number of them have said they just don't have enough information to be sure. Early in the pandemic, many prominent scientists discredited the so-called lab leak Theory One group writing a letter published in the Landsat Medical Journal saying We Stand Together to strongly condone conspiracy theories suggesting that Covid-19 does not have a natural origin, but other medical professionals have long refused to rule it out. These kinds of lab leaks happen all the time. Actually, even here in the United States we've had mishaps and in China the last six known outbreaks of SARS one have been out of labs even. Dr Anthony Fauci. The longtime director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases agreed it was possible it might possibly have been something the Chinese were doing a virus that they isolated in the wild and we're having it in the lab and then somehow it escaped out. I Don't think that happened, but I Have an open mind. According to the intelligence community's assessment, first published in 2021, the origins of the virus will remain elusive until China cooperates with global investigations. Why at this point do you say it's possible? Maybe even probable that the virus came from a lab and accidentally leaked out? The SARS Kobe 2 virus has an ancestral origin and a type of horseshoe bat that doesn't exist in Wuhan. If this comes from Nature, there would have to be some evidence of it coming from nature. Right now, we don't have that evidence now. House Republicans Are demanding more information from the State Department FBI and Doe on the origins of Covet 19. I Want to make sure that we are readying ourselves for the next pandemic. If we will and the more we can learn about natural versions and or possible lab leak, then the better off we're going to be. 10 Second trivia. An object traveling at a supersonic speed is traveling faster than 200 miles per hour. The speed of light, the speed of sound, or the speed of a hedgehog. Foreign. [Music] Supersonic object is traveling faster than the speed of sound. Continuing now with our series on the future of travel we take to the skies where one company says that they'll be able to take passengers in planes that fly twice as fast as commercial planes being used today, and that means getting to where you're going twice as fast. But here's the thing. You'd have to be willing to break the sound barrier to do so, and that means you'd be going so fast that the aircraft would create a sonic boom, which according to NASA is as loud as an explosion. or Thunderclap Here's CNN Business Correspondent: Rahel Solomon with more thank you. Planes are a ubiquitous mode of transportation. today. they've allowed us to link cities, countries, and continents like never before. but what if we could fly faster and experience more in a way that's also better for the planet? I Believe in a future where more people can go more places more often. I Think that life happens in person, that connecting across oceans is incredibly important to our future? I'm Blake Scholl Founder and CEO at Boom Supersonic. The Last Frontier in air travel was more than half a century ago when we went from propeller aircraft into the jet age, and it's been a long time since we had a step forward. I Think the next Frontier is all about making the planet more accessible, about having flights that are faster, more affordable, more convenient, and dramatically more sustainable. Just under a decade old Colorado-based startup, Boom is working to bring supersonic travel back to the skies. I Started my career as a software engineer, but I've been passionate about Aviation since I was a kid and I never understood as a tech guy why everything in our world was getting faster and better, but our flights weren't commercial. Supersonic air travel was first realized in the 1970s when Concord took flight, but after just 27 years, the fleet was retired due to a number of issues including noise, expensive overhead, and cost prohibitive tickets. The supersonic airplane fundamentally is about being able to go very efficiently at very high speed. Supersonic means flying faster than the speed of sound according to NASA Typical speeds for these aircraft range from about 1200 kilometers per hour to about 2400.. these speeds are achievable through powerful engines and a long, lean fuselage design. The downside? Supersonic travel creates a shock wave or sonic boom that is loud and disruptive over land, which is why it's only intended for long hauls across oceans. We're building on a proven foundation and delivering a new capability to passengers. It doesn't require a massive regulatory change or any regulatory change at all. We've now built Xb1, which is history's first independently developed supersonic chat, and it's going to be in the air here in the next few months to prove that all of this technology actually works. Xb1 is Boom's prototype of what will be their first airliner. Overture. According to Shoal, it's expected to be capable of going twice as fast as regular aircraft, therefore nearly having transit times. think San Francisco to Tokyo in six hours or New York to Frankfurt and a little over four with orders already placed from U.S Carriers, American and United Boom has a sky-high goal to get Overture into service by 2029.. On board the airplane, expect a large, spacious interior and beautiful large windows. It's a supersonic airplane. Actually flies higher. You'll be able to see the skies a deeper blue. Actually see the curvature of the Earth. All of that adds up to a machine that can take you across oceans, but at roughly the same cost as flying business class today. Ultimately, our goal is to make supersonic flight available to anybody who flies. There are many challenges we still have left to overcome. What we're doing is complex. It's safety critical. It requires a lot of money, but when I look back to the past I also see a lot of challenges that we've already overcome and that gives me encouragement that we will continue to do things that the world says we can't do. Supersonic flight is about making the planet dramatically more accessible when that happens. I Think we will live in a very different, more peaceful, more harmonious, more collaborative future. [Applause] And for today's story, getting a 10 out of 10 Teamwork Makes The Dream work for two Eagles building one is in the nest, then another flies in is like hey, can you help me with this other one's like what this stick and it's like yeah, can you help me put it over there? Sure, No problem. They pick up the branch and Mark it over in perfect. Rhythm If I give DJ Nader a beat, he can make them dance in mind. These Eagles get to get to be three feet tall. so their nests can get to be about six feet wide. That's wider than a queen-size bed. Well done my feathery friends. Well, that's about all we have time for today. Thanks to everyone who's reaching out at Koi Wire on Instagram Snapchat and Tick Tock And thanks to everyone showing love on our CNN 10 YouTube page Northside High School in Jackson Tennessee We see you and we are showing love right back at you. Tomorrow's Friday Can't wait, crush it today and go be awesome! I'm Koi Wire and we are CNN 10.",

Wednesday to you I Know we're just halfway through the week, but we're gonna keep grinding and Shining because that's just what we do. I'm Coy This is CNN 10 and we've got a rendezvous with the news. We're going to start with news on a vegetable shortage in the United Kingdom Certain fruits and veggies are having to be rationed at most major supermarkets and four of the biggest supermarkets in the United Kingdom say they're putting purchase limits on some staple items like tomatoes, peppers, and cucumbers. Experts say this could go on for months. Some farmers are saying that they're not harvesting any tomatoes, peppers, or eggplants when they usually do at this time of year. A number of factors like bad weather conditions in Spain and Morocco high energy costs over the winter and even the impact of Brexit and the labor shortages are causing the lack of production. Here's CNN Anchor and Correspondent Issa Suarez in London who's been speaking with local shoppers: Row upon row of empty baskets, empty shelves, a supply Gap in fruit and veg has hit UK supermarkets. The shortages affecting Shoppers Nationwide I Went for lunch and I couldn't find it like tomatoes, cucumber or lettuce. It was quite annoying when you weren't trying to get your private day in and you can't actually get it. The fruits I want to, They're gone. Nothing there to deal with the shortages. Major British supermarkets are imposing limits on items like tomatoes, cucumbers and peppers. The UK's Minister for the environment, food and Rural Affairs said A disruption should only last a few weeks. and meanwhile encouraged people to eat more seasonally let them eat turnips. she said unconscious that consumers want a year-round choice and that is what our supermarkets and food and Growers food producers and Growers around the world try to satisfy supermarkets are blaming the recent shortages on poor weather conditions in key growing regions. Britain produces a fraction of the food it consumes, relying instead on overseas Imports and key supplies in southern Europe and North Africa In particular, Spain and Morocco have seen harvests hit by extreme weather conditions. but while climate change plays a significant role in warmer than average temperatures, the government faces another Inconvenient Truth Brexit, the cause of widespread supply chain disruption because of the interruption with trade, and Europe who kind of underpin our food supply? it means that there's less food coming in from Europe we're producing less food. So basically our food security is in real trouble. Labor shortages due to a lack of Migrant workers and soaring Energy prices following Russia's invasion of Ukraine have pushed the Gap even wider as Farmers struggle with front-end costs and those costs are passed on to the consumer consumers already grappling with record high grocery prices and the worst cost of living crisis in decades. 10 Second trivia. Where would you find the world's oldest? Airport Paris France Hamburg Germany Maryland USA or North Carolina USA Thank you Flights began at Maryland's College Park airport in 1909, when Wilbur Wright trained two military Pilots and up next. we're continuing with part two of our feature from yesterday on the future of travel. new technology in the years to come will likely change travel as we know it forever. The Planes Trains and Automobiles we use today May someday be as Antiquated as the Horse and Buggy Thought leaders in the travel industry are formulating plans that might make travel faster, cheaper and safer from hyperloops to air taxis to supersonic. Jets Here's CNN's Rahel Solomon with more on the next. Frontier From highways to railways, flight paths to bike Lanes We have plenty of Mobility options on the ground and in the air, but could the next Frontier in transit take place over water Once seed bearing startup is looking to turn coastlines into corridors, Water transportation is super important because 40 of the world lives within Coastal communities. I'm Billy Tallheimer co-founder and CEO at Regent I'm Mike Clinker, one of the co-founders and CTO at Region the next Frontier is better transportation and when I say better I mean efficient and sustainable. It's faster, It's easy and affordable and accessible. Rhode Island-based company Regent is aiming to enhance the way we travel between Seaboard cities and islands with a new mode of transportation. The sea glider. The sea glider is really a mix between a boat and airplane. You took the two, smashed them together. They combined the affordability and accessibility and convenience of a boat of Ferry Transportation with the high speed and long ranges of an aircraft. The all-electric maritime vehicle is designed to float, foil and fly along dock to dock routes. The sea glider has three modes of operation. It can be floating so like a normal boat would floating on the surface of the water, driving around in the Inner Harbor areas. it has a hydrofoiling mode where you're up above the surface of water on these still so the passengers and the vehicle is insulated with any waves. The last mode is the fly mode. The sea glider takes advantage of a few Water and Air efficiencies to operate underwater. wings called hydrofoils help lift the sea glider, reduce drag, and allow for a smooth ride above the waves. When it's time to take off, the hydrofoils retract and the Sea glider won't fly within a wingspan of the water surface, benefiting from an aerodynamic principle called ground effect to Glide along a cushion of air. The sea gliders were powered by 12 by 100 horsepower electric motors and propellers on the Leading Edge of the wing. those are all fueled by battery technologists the same batteries that go into electric cars. Today, the first sea glider called Viceroy will carry 12 passengers, two crew, and service Short hauls up to 290 kilometers at speeds just under 300 kilometers per hour. Regent is still in the Prototype phase, but Tallheimer says they've already proven that technology works. Regent Just hit our our two-year anniversary. We built the first sea glider prototype and actually proved that this mode of transportation is possible. This is how we typically test our quarter scale prototype sea glider. so we're really experimenting. All operations: floating foiling When you get out of this tight area like this out into the Open Water That's when we take off and we become that wing and ground effect, that high-speed flying vehicle. And inside they're developing the avionics which will be operated by a captain. There's really two ways that you control the sea glider. You have a power lever and a side stick joystick. so think of it like you can turn left, right with the joystick and you can go tell the vehicle to go fast or Go Slow It's very intuitive, much like driving a car or driving a boat. While Regent seems to be moving along rather quickly, the co-founders say it has an all been smooth sailing. One of the biggest challenges for building a sea glider is that we are really pushing physics to the max. so it's really the combination of all these different really? Advanced Technologies that allows us to do this full mission. but it's really a physics challenge for us. I Think the other challenge we had was just the fact that this is so new. This has not existed before. So as we've gone out to customers, there's a lot of Education we need to do. You know what is it? How does it? work? How is it crude? How is it certified? Tolheimer says they have a seven billion dollar backlog in pre-orders across the airline and fairy Industries As for next steps, Regions is currently building a full-scale prototype and has Ambitions for passenger test flights by the end of 2024 and by 2050, they hope to have large capacity sea gliders in operation with ranges up to 800 kilometers. [Applause] For today's story, getting a 10 out of 10 Sticking with our Aviation theme: a record-breaking paper airplane. a team of young Boeing Engineers put themselves on the map when they set a new Guinness World Record by folding, then flying a paper airplane that went 290 feet. Holy Origami, That star near the length of a football field. Y'all it took them 20 minutes to fold the plane just right, making sure to craft it with as much weight as possible, helping them create the greatest amount of momentum after the toss. Speaking of map, dad joke alert I Got an email the other day explaining how to read maps backwards. it was spam. Shout out to Stevens Middle School in Pasco Washington we see you and I'll see all of you tomorrow I'm koi wire and we are CNN 10. [Music] foreign [Music]",

        "text_captions": "[music] Thank you Hey there everyone Terrific! Tuesday to you I'm Coy Wire and we have a special edition of CNN 10 today. We'll end with our typical 10 out of 10 story, but we're going to start with a feature piece on the future specifically of travel. Planes Trains and Automobiles. Those are typically the modes of transportation we think about when we travel today, but some folks are reimagining a future where the new modes of transportation are so efficient and so fast it could break the speed of sound that would make the entire world more accessible. Instead of going to a friend's house across town for dinner, someday we might be talking about zipping over to a friend's house across an ocean. one of the potential new forms of travel in CNN's the Next Frontier Kind of reminds me of a scene from that Blockbuster movie Elf Fantastic Sea of swirly twirly gum drops. That's right, being shot through a tube super fast CNN Business Correspondent Rahel Solomon has more about the next Frontier Weather through the air, along the track, or on the road. Modern Day Transportation has transformed the way we travel on a global scale, allowing Mobility Like never before, but as growing populations and densely packed cities stress these systems, innovators around the world are imaginating faster, more sustainable ways to get from. A to B. From supersonic planes to hyperloop pods, what may seem like a pipe dream today could be the future of Transit as early as three decades from now to. Envision The Future of Travel you Should First Look To The Past City that heralded modern day Transportation Innovation Detroit is the Motor City It's known the world over we put the world on Wheels It was here that Henry Ford pioneered the production lines that allowed us to more quickly produce vehicles in a way that improved quality and allowed more people to be able to afford cars. I'm Allison Malek and I'm the managing director of new Lab Detroit I'm working to help bring a better, more prosperous vision of Mobility for everyone around the world. When I think about Urban Mobility Some of the key pillars that are are really critical for that to be successful are: accessibility. How easy are the mobility solutions to get to, how frequent are the services running, what areas are covered. As we look towards 2050, we're going to be getting up close to 9 billion people. From a transportation perspective, it's really about options and making sure that everybody has at least two if not more of how they can get around. A lot of the systems that we're using were great. They are still great, but we actually need to think about what other Solutions can we put out that are useful and also create a great user experience. One solution that's certainly gotten a lot of hype over the last decade is the hyperloop. The proposed train in a tube is looking to upend the way we travel. With speeds up to a thousand kilometers per hour, it could zoom across an entire continent and just a few hours. Netherlands-based Heart Hyperloop is aiming to bring this high-speed technology to life. Our vision is to create a world where distance doesn't matter, where it's possible for you to be much more free in where you live, work, and how you travel to really shrink the world for people to live in. To me, the next Frontier is to realize sustainable, high-speed and convenient transport of passengers and goods. This future forward concept is actually built on the backbone of a 19th century idea where compressed air propelled rail cars through a network of pipes. Today, hyperloop technology is based on two key mechanisms: removing aerodynamic drag through vacuum-like tubes and removing friction through magnetic levitation or Maglev which makes the pods float and move forward together. These systems allow hyperloop to achieve Ultra fast speeds. Now we're in the first integrated test track that we've built. We've tested a 4, 000 kilo or 8 000 pounds vehicle to really show the normal loads that you would have on a tube and that you can still have your levitation system carry that weight. Hyper Group as a technology is very interesting. It does work. You're cutting down on things like drag and friction high level. From a basic physics perspective, that's really interesting. And according to Huzza, those properties of physics are what make hyperloop better for the environment in a hyperloop. Because you remove the aerodynamic resistance, you reduce the energy consumption, and therefore you become a much more sustainable solution. Companies across the globe are racing to make their own hyperloop, but Huzza says it's more collaborative than competitive with a collective goal to make the world more connected. There's already a lot of work being done on setting up a regulatory framework to ensure that we finally converge to a single interoperable hyperloop. Network I've been pioneering Hyperloop companies have announced they are joining forces to launch the first Global Hyperloop. Association It includes companies like Transpod, Hyperloop One, and Celeros. This newly formed pact aims to help grow this emerging Transportation Market as well as work with government and Regulatory Agencies on policy making. As we look to the Future for hyperloop, Malek says the technology is there. It'll come down to how it performs against current options. How does the capability of hyperloop match up against competitive Technologies And does it have a reason to win? We're still seeing really great performance out of Technologies like Maglev trains which are being used in Asia quite a bit already. I Think is realistic that in 2050 you could have a global hyperpath work up and running. What motivates me the most is that if we can get this done, it will have a massive impact in bringing sustainability to our Mobility patterns. [Music] [Applause] [Music] All right, continuing with our news on travel. we'll take a look at the original form of travel and that's by foot. And sometimes when you travel. you want to travel in style. Well what say you about these kicks that took New York Fashion Week by storm. The aptly named Big Red Boot make you look like you walked right out of a Super Mario game. Would you rock them? I Don't know if I would CNS Genie Moose has more These Boots Are Made For flaunting fashion, influencers are styling them. it's a goofy shoe. I Give them a 10 out of 10. even influencers of the grandpa generation wrestler Seth Rollins pretends stomped his opponent wearing big Red boots ever since they went on sale for 350 bucks and sold out in minutes. Fashionistas can't shut up about the big red boots created by the Art Collective Mischief They do make you want to touch them. Yeah, yeah! YouTube Sneakerhead Steve Natto found that out when he wore them to Sneaker Con and some people asked to touch the shoot. how do they feel? Well, the top part is flexible, but the bottom part is is definitely not. Steve says they're comfy. He wore them all day without pain. Their creator describes them as cartoonish. Some refer to them as Astro Boy boots and though they're easy to put on, getting them off can get you stuck if you're not wearing your perfect size. My foot got stuck so I Had to do I Have to do what I had to do. Man, now they're showing up on everyone from Puss in Big red boots to the character Boots from Dora the Explorer to Tony so Soprano paired with a bathrobe. people wanted to buy them right off Steve's feet offering I got like 800 900 a thousand I think I got like 13 or 1400. They just kind of kept going up. All right all You Beautiful People Thanks for spending part of your day with us. Today is February 28th National Pancake Day So happy stacking if that's your speeding and try them with peanut butter. If you're feeling frisky, shout out to Schrader Middle School Today in Grand Forks North Dakota Go! Raiders Thanks for subscribing and commenting on our CNN 10 YouTube channel.

A newly formed pact aims to help grow this emerging Transportation Market as well as work with government and Regulatory Agencies on policy making.

I'm Coy wire here with you so we can fuel our minds, dominate this week and have a little bit of fun while doing it. Our lead story on CNN 10 Today, the ongoing invasion of Ukraine Friday marked one year since Russian President Vladimir Putin launched a large-scale attack of neighboring Ukraine. It's been a full year of Destruction and loss of life. It's been a time where Ukraine has fought back and its allies have come forward to penalize Russia with sanctions on their economy while sending millions of dollars in Aid to Ukraine Ukrainian President Vladimir Zielinski has received International praise for his wartime leadership, but he has also been criticized for one he didn't warn Ukrainian citizens of the impending Invasion ahead of time why he says the decision prevented Financial panic and that it better preserved Ukraine's economy in order to fund the fight against Russia. So when might this war end? At a ceremony on Friday which remembered a somber in anniversary of events that are changing lives forever, Zielinski vowed to push for a Ukrainian victory in 2023. The day was full of commemorations Reflections and tears, but Zielinski's tone remained strong and he spoke of the country's resilience during Europe's largest and deadliest war since World War II Ukraine His exchanges with Ukrainian soldiers on Friday were vintage. Vladimir Zielinski, Zielinski told his army they would be the ones to decide whether Ukraine will exist in the future or not. But one year after Russia's Invasion, few doubt that Ukraine's fate hinges in no small part on the man who's emerged as an effective wartime leader. The man has a spine and obviously when you are truly David fighting Goliath if you don't have a spine, you you lose 12 months later. he is the hard-bitten leader. I Mean he has been through a year of of trial like no other leader and from the first moments of the war, it seemed like Zelenski was up to the challenge. like when he posted a video message on Facebook from the streets of Kiev with his cabinet on the second night of the invasion. The President is here. We are all here. Our military is here. Vladimir Zelenski has since dominated The Narrative from a stirring appearance before a joint session of the U.S Congress Ukraine is alive and Kicking to what he said to the British House of Commons we will not give up and we will not lose. We will fight in the forests, in the fields, on the shores, on the streets. Compare that to what Winston Churchill said after the evacuation of Dunkirk We should fight in the fields and in the streets. We can fight in the Hills we shall Never Surrender He has successfully mimicked Winston Churchill himself. Vladimir Zolenski has mobilized the United States of America former U.S ambassador to Ukraine William Taylor remembers Zielinski in the early months of his presidency as a good-natured, somewhat naive politician. How has the war changed? Zielinski is less jovial. Um, he's less. he's more focused, He's more determined, He's more somber. I Mean this is a hard a hard time to go through and he's had it all on his shoulders. Still, no one's been able to keep Vladimir Zielinski from the front lines in places like Harrison and Bucha. Compare that to Vladimir Putin's isolation in the Kremlin he appears fearful. You just get the sense of uh' of a man alone, whereas Zelenski is among his people among his team and in the fight. The analysts we spoke to say that unless Vladimir Zielinski makes some colossal and unforeseen mistakes, his legacy will likely be very impressive. If Ukraine wins the war, he'll go down as one of the greatest leaders of the century. If Ukraine loses, he's remembered as a tragic hero. 10 Second Trivia, Which of these nations is the most populated Nation on the African continent. Ethiopia Nigeria Egypt or South Africa Nigeria with around 220 million people, is the most populated country in Africa. And up next, we're headed to Nigeria The country is Africa's largest democracy and its people are voting to elect their next president and vice president. The election comes at a time when two-thirds of the population are living in poverty and almost half of the young people are unemployed. The value of the currency there is low, while inflation is high and violence and terrorism have reshaped everyday life. Across The Nation We'll hear now from CNN International Correspondent Larry Madowo as Nigerians are making their voices heard in one of the country's most competitive and unpredictable elections in quite some time was an outclose Nationwide in Nigeria's Tyson Selection Ever. And what happens now is the slow, painstaking process of counting the vote. What do you have back there is? they hold up a ballot one by one. Everybody watching has to agree that that's the person that they voted for and so that will take a while, which is why we can't predict exactly when the results will be known. The independent National Electoral Commission says they will do it speedily. It might be a couple of days until we know. There were a few reported instances of violence and parts of Lagos and other parts of the country, but these are isolated. It's not a pattern that we can see at least. Apparently there were also at least 200 polling stations where voting didn't take place because of insecurity and security has been a major issue for voters in this election, but the election is taking part in the backdrop of a major Fuel and cash shortage. It's led to some chaotic scenes at gas stations and at Banks and now whoever becomes an expression of Nigeria has to deal with an economy on the verge of crumbling. There are 18 people running, but only three men have a realistic chance of becoming the next president of Africa's most populous nation during election is a massive logistical nightmare. 93 million registered voters is more than the next 14 West African nations combined. So it's sort of like organizing election for an entire subcontinent in just one day. And that's why at this location, for instance, and two of the polling stations, there were no votes happening and they don't understand why, But people we spoke to told us that we wait for as long as it takes because they want to make a statement in this election. All right, Sports Fans! Take Me Out to the Ball Game Just don't make me stay all day. New rules in Major League Baseball Aimed at speeding up the game or taking spring training by storm. MLB is implementing a pitch clock sort of like a shot clock in basketball pitchers and batters. They can't take their good old time anymore. just 15 seconds between pitches with empty bases 20 seconds when there are Runners on base. If pitchers don't get the pitch off in time, it counts as a ball for the batter. But the rule also states that if the batter isn't ready by eight seconds left, well like the Padres Manny Machado found out they're gonna get a strike called against him. Well, with this new rule, we're seeing spring training games finishing around 25 to 30 minutes faster than last year's average of three hours and three minutes. We've seen some games that finished an hour faster. Now, some other big rule changes: This season: pitchers can only attempt two pick-off throws per at bat. The size of the bases is increasing from 15 square inches to 18, and defenses can no longer shift. Their infielders. Players have about a month to retrain their brains before the season. opening day is March 30th [Applause] For today's story, getting a 10 out of 10, a two-month-old baby that already weighs 50 pounds Meet Petunia, a two-month-old baby hippopotamus at the Metro Richmond Zoo in Virginia And not just any hippo. Petunia and her mama Iris are pygmy hippos, and there are fewer than 2500 mature pygmy hippos remaining in the world. So with each step and with each Splash in the pool, Petunia is keeping hope for these hippos alive. All right. Time's almost up for today. But for all my go-getters out there, one more thing, remember: complacency is the constant enemy, so outwork everyone every single day.

In fact, there are penguins that can be found waddling around the warm, dry. Shores In South Africa with not a major snow bank in sight and learn something new every day on the show. This particular penguin population, though, is dwindling in large part because they're having trouble making their nests, so humans are stepping in to build them some sweet new digs. CNN Went to check in on the tuxedo birds and we'll go there now to learn some more. Antarctica Is known to have the largest population of penguins in the world, but not all penguins live in snow and ice. Some can be found waddling along the balmy shores of southern Africa on Barren and Windswept islands like this one. But in the last century, populations of the endangered African penguin have plummeted during part to human disturbance, egg poaching, and climate change. Ondai Island in the 1970s, there was about 23 000 breeding pairs. At the moment, we're Counting about 1 100 breeding pairs. It's quite a severe collapse. Historically, African penguins made nests in boroughs of guano, layers of accumulated seabird and bad feces. but in the 19th century humans began to exploit guano supplies and sell it as fertilizer, leaving penguins and their eggs exposed to predators and a scorching. Sun At one point in the colonies, it ranged from 3 to 10 meters in depth and even deeper in some areas. Right now, the deepest guano remaining in any of the colonies measures in the centimeters. The only thing left is bare gravel Bears oil. Nothing that they can burrow into and that took away their their entire nesting ability. In 2016, the African Penguin Nest project dived to the rescue. a coordinated effort between Dire Island Conservation Trust Dallas Zoo and other organizations. Its mission is to design and deploy artificial nests that give penguin parents a safe and cool place to raise their chicks. After two years of development and studying old guano nests project experts settled on a final design which they started deploying in late 2018. The aim was to emulate Mother Nature as closely as possible. We made the entrance hall small so that the Penguins can squeeze in and as soon as they turn around, they can protect that entrance hole from any predator. It looks a little bit strange when you look at it, but it's an exact copy of what the Penguins build themselves if they were given the opportunity. Each Nest is fitted with a sensor that measures temperature and humidity which enables researchers to track the nest's microclimate. Eggs are an extremely delicate structure. they're only set to be incubated at about 38 to 39 to degrees any higher than that, and there's a very real risk of the eggs dying. We're going to constantly be looking at the performance of the nests when it comes to the usage rates are the Penguins using them are the eggs hatching, are the chicks fledging. But so far what we're seeing is that the artificial nests are fledging chicks at a much higher rate than any other option that they have funded by donations or by people sponsoring individual nests. Graham says the project is so far installed more than 1500 nests around South Africa's penguin colonies. Next year, the project hopes to expand to penguin colonies in Namibia. The end goal is that every penguin that needs a nest will get one. I Think we have got a responsibility as humans because you know we've kind of intruded onto a place and messed things up a little bit. But we also can fix it. I Never think of an African penguin as cute and cuddly I Think of an African penguin as absolutely tenacious I think there are such survivors and they should be an example to all of us that you can overcome.

Check out this crooked grin canine its name Paul Ruff named after actor Paul Rudd it's his doggy doppelganger Ruff was a shelter dog in Tennessee but good news is he found a forever home after he went viral when people pointed out that he had a celebrity twin. All right! I Want to give a special shout out to Forest Creek Middle School in Fort Mill South Carolina what's up Hudson I Also want to send big virtual hugs to miss Mindy and all the Hibbard Wildcats who watch us every morning. yeah representing I'm at Koi Wire on Insta Snapchat and Tick Tock we're CNN 10 on YouTube Have an awesome weekend and remember you are more powerful than you know.

States are under winter weather alerts warning of heavy snow, severe icing, extreme cold. Up next, we're taking a trip to see some penguins in need of some help. Learn something new every day on the show. African penguins made nests in boroughs of guano, layers of accumulated seabird and bad feces. In the 19th century humans began to exploit guano supplies and sell it as fertilizer, leaving penguins and their eggs exposed to predators and a scorching sun. In 2016, the African Penguin Nest project dived to the rescue to create artificial nests that give penguin parents a safe and cool place to raise their chicks."

        "text_captions": "[music] Thank you What's up lovely people! It's Thursday So happy Friday Eve and welcome to CNN 10. I'm Coy Wire Happy to be with you today. Let's dominate this day. We're going to start with big news on the weather front: A massive winter storm is threatening the United States Coast to Coast all the way from California and the West to Maine in the east. On Wednesday More than 65 million Americans were under winter weather alerts warning of severe icing and extreme cold making driving and flying very dangerous. More than 1 000 flights in the U.S had already been canceled on Wednesday at the time of the show's taping and more than 2 million people are under blizzard warnings across parts of Wyoming The Dakotas Wisconsin and Minnesota. The Minneapolis area in Minnesota could see historic snowfall totals on Tuesday in Northern California Strong wind gusts knocked the power out in more than 140 000 homes and businesses in Northern Californians Can also expect to see several in inches of snow. We'll continue to track this storm right here on CNN 10, but please be smart and stay safe. Next up an update on the train derailment in East Palestine Ohio which spilled toxic chemicals that are threatening the health and well-being of residents there. Wednesday Morning the Environmental Protection Agency ordered Norfolk Southern Rail Company to cover all of the cleanup costs, but the rail company is facing further pressure. Residents and state officials still have questions about the rail companies handling of the situation and they seek to hold them accountable for any potential wrongdoing. CNN's Miguel Marquez is in East Palestine with more a toxic mess left by its Durrell train now President Joe Biden Adding his pressure on Norfolk Southern following criticism for his response to the crash on Instagram Biden wrote Norfolk Southern's imposed payments and cleanup operations are common sense because quote this is their mess and they should clean it up. The company is reiterating its commitment to East Palestine Residents from day one, I've made the commitment that Norfolk Southern is going to remediate the site, but still it is facing accusations of mismanagement like this from Pennsylvania's Governor Josh Shapiro They chose not to participate in the Unified Command. They gave us inaccurate information and conflicting modeling data. I was at Unified Command and I can tell you that the governors of Ohio and Pennsylvania Mayor, Conaway Fire Chief Dravic A, National Guard and Norfolk Southern were aligned that the control burned. The control release was the safest course of action for the citizens of East Palestine Governor Shapiro Announced a criminal referral to the Attorney General's office over the crash and its Fallout Ohio Governor Mike Dewine also said his Attorney General is reviewing possible legal action against Norfolk Southern, but the train company says it is committed to helping East Palestine for the Long Haul We're going to do continuous long-term air and water monitoring. We're going to help the residents of this community recover and we're going to invest in the long-term health of this community. And we're going to make Norfolk Southern a safe for railroad. According to its CEO Norfolk Southern has reimbursed 6.5 million dollars to East Palestine residents. so far this as the company continues to monitor air and water quality. There it says hundreds of tests conducted have come back clean. During a visit to East Palestine head of the EPA Michael Regan said he's confident in the tests. Our data is very solid and if the homes have been cleared and tested for drinking water, then we trust that data so we feel really good about that to prove that Regan and Governor Dewine drank from the same water sources that are being tested. However, Governor Dewine says more work needs to be done to remove contaminated soil from the area. The soil under the tracks had not been dealt with. So under the administrator's order that soil will be removed so the tracks will have to be taken up and that soil will have to be removed. Despite all these actions and guarantees, East Palestine Mayor Trent Conaway says his community is still concerned about overall safety. We don't need our town cleaned up. We need our residents to feel safe in their homes. That's the number one thing. Your home is your sanctuary. If you don't feel safe in your home, then you're never going to feel safe anywhere. Next up, as part of the Fallout from the suspected Chinese spy Bloom that flew over the United States earlier this month, the U.S announced a new round of sanctions or penalties against six Chinese aerospace companies that they believe supported a Chinese Military Reconnaissance balloon program today in a CNN exclusive will. Ripley takes us to a place few Outsiders have seen to try to learn more about what the secretive manufacturers could be up to hundreds of miles from Beijing a place China doesn't want you to see CNN The first International Media to come here behind a sea of barbed wire and security checkpoints, the base of a blacklisted balloon manufacturer, one of six Chinese entities, the U.S government sanctioned. After that suspected spy balloon shot it, shot down, pulled up and sent to an FBI lab, each piece providing more proof. The U.S says this was no weather balloon deflating. denial after denial by Beijing China's foreign Ministry calls the whole thing an accident. the balloon and unmanned civilian Airship CNN's searched for the truth behind the balloon took our team from the Chinese Capital to Shanxi Province about 300 miles Southwest of Beijing days of digging and geolocation technology took us down this road to a place few Outsiders have seen. No International Media has ever come this close. What did we find? An active industrial complex with possible ties to the Chinese military's vast, highly secretive Aerospace program Eagles Men Aviation Science and Technology or Emast blacklisted by the U.S Commerce Department CNN Searched corporate records suggesting Emast has permits to develop and manufacture products for the Chinese military. the first thing we notice a giant white Dome A closer look shows the company logo inside that Dome A lab we dug up a 2017 Chinese State Media report. The report says this is where workers test high altitude balloons like the one that flew over the U.S Our team spotted two more massive structures. They look like giant tents. CNN Cameras also capture this what seems to be an assault helicopter on display and listen to this. That same state media report. Never once does it mention meteorology. It boasts The balloons can carry multiple detectors Communications equipment used for civilian and Military surveillance and reconnaissance CNN Tried to get answers from all six companies on the U.S Blacklist No response from Emast or the others. They're not talking about the balloon, but President Joe Biden is I Make no apologies for taking down that balloon. a suspected spy balloon. We may never know for sure who made it China is sticking to its weather balloon claim dismissed by the Pentagon as nothing but hot air 10 Second Trivia which of these countries is the world's largest producer of oranges. Mexico United States Brazil or Cyprus [Music] About one-third of the world's oranges are grown in Brazil [Music] [Applause] It's the annual Battle of the oranges at the Avra Carnival. Thousands of people taking part in the biggest food fight in Italy. The battles oranges date back to nearly a thousand years, representing a Revolt by the commoners in Ivorya who would rise up against the evil, tyrannical Duke's armies. The town is festooned with banners, pennants, and plenty of OJ. The oranges are said to be unsuitable for commercial purposes. so the Citrus Slingers hurl more than 4 million oranges during the three days of Celebration leading up to Lent. All right, shout out time Now it's going out to Tallland High School in Tallinn Connecticut Today rise up and thanks to all who made Hashtag your word Wednesday Submission is like lead to the rates from Central High in Chattanooga Tennessee today's word festoon if you heard it it means to Adorn a place with decorations before we go. One more thing. One of the greatest characteristics we can possess as we chase our goals is not ability, it's adaptability. The top Achievers in this world don't have all the answers in the beginning, nor do they have all the tools they need to succeed our goals. They may seem unattainable at times and we will fail as we chase them, but if we keep pushing and become like a chameleon and keep adapting, good things will happen. See you tomorrow, Lovely people! I'm Koi and we are CNN 10.",

        "text_captions": "[music] Thank you Hello lovely people! Wonderful Wednesday to you I'm Koi Wire and we are so grateful that you're making us part of your day right here on CNN 10 The best 10 minutes in news. Random thought for you before we start. Why is it that we park on a driveway but we drive on a Parkway? All right, let's shift into high gear. Now we start today with more on President Biden's visit to Ukraine On Tuesday, the President gave a speech in Poland after making a surprise visit to Ukraine on Monday. Nearly one year after Russia started its Invasion There, the President recommitted the support of the United States and its resources to Ukraine. This, despite the rising costs of sending Aid the U.S has already given about 30 billion dollars In recent polls show public support for America Continuing to send weapons to Ukraine is fading as well, down to 48 percent last month when 60 percent of Americans supported it back in May just hours earlier on. Tuesday Russian President Vladimir Putin slammed the West in his annual State of the Nation address in Moscow casting Russia as the victim saying that it was Ukraine and its Western allies who started the war. He says Russia's military efforts in Ukraine are to protect themselves and Putin offered no signs of backing down from their presence in Ukraine. So why did President Biden risk entering an active war zone that isn't showing any signs of settling down in the near future? Biden Was not the first President to make a trip to a war zone, but he is the first to do so without a U.S military presence in the region to protect him. Here's CNN's Brian Todd to tell us about other U.S Presidents who traveled to war zones and why they did that. It was at the height of World War II and the conflict still wasn't going America's way. President Franklin Delano Roosevelt Engaged in a high-stakes game of misdirection, tricking journalists into thinking he was taking a train to his home in Upstate New York but he secretly switched trains in Baltimore headed to Miami, then took a series of arduous plane Hops and ended up in Casablanca Morocco It was January 1943, the first time a sitting American President rode on an airplane, a trip shrouded in secrecy so that FDR could strategize with Winston Churchill a journey fraught with danger in World War II you not only had the possibility of the commander-in-chief being shot down, but the technology was such that air travel was not as safe in the 1940s as as it is today. Some U.S troops in Morocco didn't know their president was coming until he rode past them in a jeep. Historians say war zone trips for American presidents have always been complicated, even dating back to the Civil War At least 12 Presidents have gone to war zones in the past, starting of course with Abraham Lincoln In the Civil War there are those famous pictures of him in his top hat visiting Union Soldiers to boost their morale, but it is a big risk. Lyndon B Johnson Went twice as president Richard Nixon once to Vietnam while the war there was raging I know when Nixon went in 1969 to Saigon all of his advisors were saying don't do it, it's too dangerous George W Bush Barack Obama and Donald Trump went to Iraq and Afghanistan to visit U.S Troops: When those presidents went to Kabul and Baghdad respectively, they were taking huge risks when George H.W Bush, as a former president, visited Kuwait in 1993. Saddam Hussein's intelligence service tried to have Iraqi operatives assassinate him. a plot that was narrowly foiled. Presidents have taken these risks to boost troops morale, to strategize with other commanders, and sometimes to decide whether a war should even continue. I shall go to Korea That was Dwight D Eisenhower's objective as President-elect when he took a secret trip to South Korea in December 1952. Eisenhower not only went to meet the troops, not only went to meet the South Korean leader, but actually took a plane over Chinese and North Korean positions to get a view himself of the nature of their defenses. That's an extremely hazardous trip. Historian Tim Naftali says, despite the sometimes incredible risks, the rewards are very high that as Commander-in-chief it's crucial for a President to show their commitment to the fight and to show that not only to American forces, but to their adversaries as well. 10 Second Trivia What Italian City is also known by the nickname Sarah Nisima, Palermo Genoa Venice or Florence meaning Serene La Serenissima was a nickname for the Republic of Venice Ah, Venice the floating city with people being serenaded and gondolas as they drift through winding canals under hundreds of walkways and bridges. But those famous canals look a lot different right now. They're so dried up that many of the gondolas and Water Taxis are sadly sitting on empty waterways and there are fears that Italy will face a drought for a second straight summer following an extremely dry winter. Now these images are a stark contrast from those of just a few years ago. In 2019, water poured into restaurants, shops, and famous landmarks like Saint Mark's Basilica in Venice as it battled its worst flood in 50 years. Here's reporting from CNN International correspondent Scott McLean During that time, as we try to imagine the scope of issues Venetians had to deal with the last several years, high tide on Saturday was actually welcome relief for Venetians struggling with the worst flooding in half a century. It filled historic Saint Mark's Square but was not enough to do more damage than already done. This Cafe opened for the first time since Tuesday's High Watermark sent more than a foot of water inside enough to break the dishwasher and the fridge. This waiter told us your Venetians roll up our sleeves and start working again. Venice is our lady, we will protect her. Meanwhile, at Saint Mark's Basilica the water at the door didn't knock before entering, but it still got their attention. We have a we have more than this level of water. It's not uncommon for water to enter the outer Atrium. It was even a special drainage system to handle it, but Pierre Paulo Campostrini says it was just the second time. There's been significant flooding in the main chamber 10 centimeters there and another meter in the Crypt. The water came and went quickly, but the salt in the water stays in the 900 year old walls much longer, eating away at the marble and brick near the floor and even on the Mosaic ceiling. And that's the damage. and that's the damage. The Basilica has survived centuries of threats, but nothing like the one it faces today. [Applause] For today's story, getting a 10 out of 10, you're going to meet George A young Detroit Red Wings fan who went to his very first game and he and his mom were in for a huge surprise when George became a big time hit on the Jumbotron [applause] first hockey game in the Jumbotron eat him up Red Wing Fans buoy opposing fans from Vancouver and cheering every time George came up even if he didn't quite get it. the opposition, the home team George finally cracked a smile and went viral King George they called him I see a George bobblehead Knight but it didn't give George a big head like he didn't know it was about him and just kept saying like yes, red Team's winning Chelsea Miller describes her four-year-old son is shy amid a whirlwind of attention. There were probably at least 100 people that asked to stop to take pictures with him and high fives and can I get an autograph. Even mom says they were hoping his sign would get George on camera but they weren't expecting this. Everyone just made it so special for us. University of Michigan hockey wondered George do you need a Michigan jersey for the next game? George's Grandma here and he definitely needs a Jersey Nothing brings people together like sports.

        "text_captions": "[music] Thank you Hello lovely people! Wonderful Wednesday to you I'm Koi Wire and we are so grateful that you're making us part of your day right here on CNN 10 The best 10 minutes in news. Random thought for you before we start. Why is it that we park on a driveway but we drive on a Parkway? All right, let's shift into high gear. Now we start today with more on President Biden's visit to Ukraine On Tuesday, the President gave a speech in Poland after making a surprise visit to Ukraine on Monday. Nearly one year after Russia started its Invasion There, the President recommitted the support of the United States and its resources to Ukraine. This, despite the rising costs of sending Aid the U.S has already given about 30 billion dollars In recent polls show public support for America Continuing to send weapons to Ukraine is fading as well, down to 48 percent last month when 60 percent of Americans supported it back in May just hours earlier on. Tuesday Russian President Vladimir Putin slammed the West in his annual State of the Nation address in Moscow casting Russia as the victim saying that it was Ukraine and its Western allies who started the war. He says Russia's military efforts in Ukraine are to protect themselves and Putin offered no signs of backing down from their presence in Ukraine. So why did President Biden risk entering an active war zone that isn't showing any signs of settling down in the near future? Biden Was not the first President to make a trip to a war zone, but he is the first to do so without a U.S military presence in the region to protect him. Here's CNN's Brian Todd to tell us about other U.S Presidents who traveled to war zones and why they did that. It was at the height of World War II and the conflict still wasn't going America's way. President Franklin Delano Roosevelt Engaged in a high-stakes game of misdirection, tricking journalists into thinking he was taking a train to his home in Upstate New York but he secretly switched trains in Baltimore headed to Miami, then took a series of arduous plane Hops and ended up in Casablanca Morocco It was January 1943, the first time a sitting American President rode on an airplane, a trip shrouded in secrecy so that FDR could strategize with Winston Churchill a journey fraught with danger in World War II you not only had the possibility of the commander-in-chief being shot down, but the technology was such that air travel was not as safe in the 1940s as as it is today. Some U.S troops in Morocco didn't know their president was coming until he rode past them in a jeep. Historians say war zone trips for American presidents have always been complicated, even dating back to the Civil War At least 12 Presidents have gone to war zones in the past, starting of course with Abraham Lincoln In the Civil War there are those famous pictures of him in his top hat visiting Union Soldiers to boost their morale, but it is a big risk. Lyndon B Johnson Went twice as president Richard Nixon once to Vietnam while the war there was raging I know when Nixon went in 1969 to Saigon all of his advisors were saying don't do it, it's too dangerous George W Bush Barack Obama and Donald Trump went to Iraq and Afghanistan to visit U.S Troops: When those presidents went to Kabul and Baghdad respectively, they were taking huge risks when George H.W Bush, as a former president, visited Kuwait in 1993. Saddam Hussein's intelligence service tried to have Iraqi operatives assassinate him. a plot that was narrowly foiled. Presidents have taken these risks to boost troops morale, to strategize with other commanders, and sometimes to decide whether a war should even continue. I shall go to Korea That was Dwight D Eisenhower's objective as President-elect when he took a secret trip to South Korea in December 1952. Eisenhower not only went to meet the troops, not only went to meet the South Korean leader, but actually took a plane over Chinese and North Korean positions to get a view himself of the nature of their defenses. That's an extremely hazardous trip. Historian Tim Naftali says, despite the sometimes incredible risks, the rewards are very high that as Commander-in-chief it's crucial for a President to show their commitment to the fight and to show that not only to American forces, but to their adversaries as well. 10 Second Trivia What Italian City is also known by the nickname Sarah Nisima, Palermo Genoa Venice or Florence meaning Serene La Serenissima was a nickname for the Republic of Venice Ah, Venice the floating city with people being serenaded and gondolas as they drift through winding canals under hundreds of walkways and bridges. But those famous canals look a lot different right now. They're so dried up that many of the gondolas and Water Taxis are sadly sitting on empty waterways and there are fears that Italy will face a drought for a second straight summer following an extremely dry winter. Now these images are a stark contrast from those of just a few years ago. In 2019, water poured into restaurants, shops, and famous landmarks like Saint Mark's Basilica in Venice as it battled its worst flood in 50 years. Here's reporting from CNN International correspondent Scott McLean During that time, as we try to imagine the scope of issues Venetians had to deal with the last several years, high tide on Saturday was actually welcome relief for Venetians struggling with the worst flooding in half a century. It filled historic Saint Mark's Square but was not enough to do more damage than already done. This Cafe opened for the first time since Tuesday's High Watermark sent more than a foot of water inside enough to break the dishwasher and the fridge. This waiter told us your Venetians roll up our sleeves and start working again. Venice is our lady, we will protect her. Meanwhile, at Saint Mark's Basilica the water at the door didn't knock before entering, but it still got their attention. We have a we have more than this level of water. It's not uncommon for water to enter the outer Atrium. It was even a special drainage system to handle it, but Pierre Paulo Campostrini says it was just the second time. There's been significant flooding in the main chamber 10 centimeters there and another meter in the Crypt. The water came and went quickly, but the salt in the water stays in the 900 year old walls much longer, eating away at the marble and brick near the floor and even on the Mosaic ceiling. And that's the damage. and that's the damage. The Basilica has survived centuries of threats, but nothing like the one it faces today. [Applause] For today's story, getting a 10 out of 10, you're going to meet George A young Detroit Red Wings fan who went to his very first game and he and his mom were in for a huge surprise when George became a big time hit on the Jumbotron [applause] first hockey game in the Jumbotron eat him up Red Wing Fans buoy opposing fans from Vancouver and cheering every time George came up even if he didn't quite get it. the opposition, the home team George finally cracked a smile and went viral King George they called him I see a George bobblehead Knight but it didn't give George a big head like he didn't know it was about him and just kept saying like yes, red Team's winning Chelsea Miller describes her four-year-old son is shy amid a whirlwind of attention.

At least 12 Presidents have gone to war zones in the past, starting with Abraham Lincoln. Historians say war zone trips for American presidents have always been complicated, even dating back to the Civil War. High tide on Saturday was actually welcome relief for Venetians struggling with the worst flooding in 50 years. At Saint Mark's Basilica the water at the door didn't knock before entering, but it still got their attention. The water came and went quickly, but the salt in the water stays in the 900 year old walls much longer, eating away at the marble and brick."

        "text_captions": "[music] Thank you hello everyone! Terrific! Tuesday To you it's your boy Coy I Hope you had a wonderful weekend and a pleasant President's Day holiday I Am pumped to be back here with you To start this week off strong. We're going to begin with the latest news out of Ukraine This week President Biden made an unexpected visit to Kiev. It was his first visit since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine almost a year ago. Here's part of what the President had to say about this trip: that dark night one year ago, the world was literally at the time bracing for the fall cave. One year later, Keith stands and Ukraine stands. Democracy stands, The American stands with you and the world stands with you. Now there is a long history of American presidents visiting War zones. This trip was unprecedented in modern history. however, because the American President traveled to an active war zone without a large U.S military presence President Biden said his trip was to reaffirm the quote unwavering support that the United States holds for Ukraine Earlier this month, the United States said Russia has committed crimes against humanity in Ukraine. That was an escalation of what they'd said previously Russia called the accusation an excuse for Washington to further the conflict during his trip. President Biden also announced new military assistance for Ukraine and incoming sanctions against Moscow. We'll keep you informed on any more updates from the President's trip, as well as new information on the ongoing war overseas and over the weekend, the secretive nation of North Korea launched a series of missile tests off the coast of the Korean Peninsula. The country country says the missiles have enough range to hit the United States, but the U.S has said this weekend's events, they don't pose any immediate threat to U.S Personnel or territory. The tests do, however, highlight the destabilizing impact of North Korea's illegal missile program. North Korean Leader Kim Jong-un's sister warned of more threats to come unless the United States halts military drills. with South Korea more now from Paula Hancock's CNN International correspondent based in Seoul South Korea It has been a busy few days on the Korean Peninsula North Korea On Saturday launching a significant missile on Sunday and Monday, we have seen Tit for Tat retaliation from both sides North Korea and also the U.S and South Korea on the other side. So what we saw on Saturday Pyongyang admitted a day later was an intercontinental ballistic missile. Now, these they claim can hit mainland United States and they are the ones that do concern Washington We heard from Kim yo Jong Kim Jong-un's sister that this actually shows that they have missile re-entry technology. Now it's very difficult to know if that is in fact the case, but that is what Pyongyang is claiming at this point. So what we saw on Sunday then just one day later was a concerted show of force by the U.S and South Korean Air Force Air Forces They flew sorties over the Korean Peninsula including at least one B1 bomber escorted by South Korean fighter jets and then in response response to that, we saw this Monday morning from Pyongyang two launches. Now they say that it was a super large multiple rocket launcher exercise in retaliation for what they saw the day before. So this is really a latest cycle of Tit for Tat retaliation. but certainly the Saturday launch was the significant one. But we're not expecting the tensions or this Tit for Tat retaliation to to diminish anytime soon because Pyongyang says it is doing so because the US and South Korea are carrying out joint militar drills and if they continue to do that, then they will continue to respond. Now we know that this week at the Pentagon there will be a nuclear tabletop drill between the US and South Korea and then next month there will be a larger joint military drill between the two countries. Up next, we're traveling to Canada in search of zombies, but not the type of zombies you'd typically think of. Ever heard of zombie fires? I had neither until now. They're essentially fires that were never totally put out at the end of a fire season, and they burn underground, threatening to come back from beneath the surface at any moment to wreak havoc once more. We'll hear more now from an international team of researchers who are on the hunt for the next fire that could be lurking beneath the earth's surface in the remote boreal forests of Canada's Northwest Territories and Rebecca Scholten, along with an international team of researchers is on the hunt for signs of a rare and destructive phenomenon. So the first thing you notice when you get to a site that has had a zombie fire is that a lot of these trees have fallen over and that is because of the underground burning that is happening In 2015, this region of Boreal forest was the scene of an overwintering fire also known as a zombie fire. These are rare, so we don't have any footage of them, but they can look just like these regular forest fires except they're back from the dead. So these are fires that are not extinguished at the end of a fire season, but instead they smoldered deep into the organic soil layer. And when the snow comes, the snow kind of protects them from the adverse winter conditions and that makes it possible for them to smolder or throughout winter. And when the snow melts and there's dry fuels available again, these fires come up to the surface again and start a new flaming forest fire. In 2021, Scholten published the first ever scientific study to detect zombie fires using satellites and reports from local fire managers as part of her PhD For example, in the summer of 2015, a fire in Southwest Alaska blazed across 26 square miles. Winter came and snow covered the fire site, but the following spring the fire returned along the old burn scar. Evidence Shelton says of a zombie fire by burning through the soil and The Roots zombie fires can be more damaging to the forest than regular fires, making it harder for them to recover. but that's not all. these Boreal soils store huge amounts of carbon, so burning them releases it as carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Zombie fires are rare, but Shelton found that they are increasing due to climate change. So I Think Zombifies a very good poster child for what is happening to Arctic wildfires in general. So we see fire regimes are intensifying and this has very important impact on the ecosystems. That of course has an impact on our climate and that is why I Think everyone in the world should care about these fires. 10 Second Trivia Which of these words comes from a Latin term that described a wind from the north Zephyr Bluster Boreal or arboreal. [Music] Zephyr was a West Wind but when you're talking about a North Wind you're speaking in boreal terms. Oh yeah, it's going all the way. Oh yeah, right above. Wow, look at how bright that is. [Music] [Applause] All right today's story. getting a 10 out of 10. a shark attack only this time it's the shark getting attacked by a dog. That's right, a big old hammerhead shark. One boater said it was probably about 12 feet long. Just mine in this business in the Bahamas until a dog spots the monster cruising beneath the surface. and Cannonball the dog jumps into the water and starts chasing the shark away. The people on the tour boat were screaming in disbelief in horror. The dog is the pet of the caretaker who manages the Private Island pardon my sarcasm, little doggy. but something tells me year one jawsitively lucky pup. The voters were relieved when the dog safely swam back to the shore unharmed. Fun fact for the day. Did you know that baby sharks are called pups? Learn something new every day. Shout out Time now! Hudsonville High School and Hudson Bill Michigan We see you. Also shout out to Mr Ben Lewis at Brenham Middle School In Brenham Texas he challenged his students to interview a military veteran, an immigrant and an American citizen over 60 years old to learn about different perspectives and to gain better understanding of what it means to be an American He turned the interviews into this book. Percy is going to help deserving military veterans. We Salute You Mr Lewis And to all of the students who sent me a lovely note with all these signatures, you totally rocked it out. We'll see you tomorrow everyone! I'm Coy Wire and we are CNN Tech Hmm. thank you.",

The secretive nation of North Korea launched a series of missile tests off the coast of the Korean Peninsula. Up next, we're traveling to Canada in search of zombies, but not the type of zombies. Zombie fires are rare, but they are increasing due to climate change. Snow protects them from the adverse winter conditions and that makes it possible for them to smolder. When the snow melts and there's dry fuels available again, these fires come up to the surface again and start a new flaming forest fire."

        "text_captions": "[music] Thank you hello lovely people, You made it! The weekend is upon us. Friday is here and Fridays Rock Especially this Friday Because we're headed into a three day weekend, we have a lot of news to get through today, so not a lot of time to do it. Let's get to it. We're going to begin with the latest out of New Zealand where the country just declared a national State of Emergency Cyclone Gabriel Hit New Zealand with wind and rain, knocking out power to tens of thousands of homes in the area. The wind gusts were greater than 87 miles per hour. Waves were close to 36 feet high. When we recorded this show, the storm had killed at least five people and caused widespread damage. Police in the area say they remain focused on locating those people that are unaccounted for what exactly is a cyclone. Let's break it down: Cyclones Hurricanes and typhoons are essentially the same, with only the location of the storm determining what we call it. For example, the only difference between a hurricane and a typhoon is that typhoons happen in the Western and North Pacific while Waters while hurricanes occur in the eastern and North Pacific and the North Atlantic Basin. That's why whenever we talk about these types of storms in the U.S it's almost always a hurricane Cyclones happen only in the Indian Ocean in the South Pacific We'll keep you updated as news unfold surrounding the cyclone in New Zealand As the worst of the weather looks to have passed, significant and potentially life-threatening challenges remain next story today earlier this month, a Norfolk Southern Train which was carrying toxic chemicals at the time, derailed from the tracks and crashed in Eastern. Ohio Now, the derailment ignited the Hazardous chemicals on board covering the town of East Palestine with smoke. Authorities created an evacuation Zone around the crash and fearing a major explosion, performed a controlled release of the chemicals. Weeks Later Residents have been encouraged to return home, but there are lots of questions about just how harmful exposure to these chemicals could be. The plumes of smoke from the explosion carry the hazardous material into the air and water to which residents would be exposed with all eyes on. Ohio The U.S Environmental Protection Agency Administrator otherwise known as EPA Michael Regan Visited the region on Thursday to assess the ongoing response and hear from impacted residents. Here's CNN's National correspondent Jason Carroll who's been on the ground in Ohio for the last few days covering this story for us. We're strongly recommending those who have not yet had their water source checked to use bottled water. Bottled water is being made available more than a week after a toxic train derailment that led to the evacuation of much of this small Ohio town. State Health Officials are urging some East Palestine residents to drink bottled water until water tests are complete. Officials say the toxic spill was largely contained the day after the derailment and the tests have shown the air quality is safe, but they have found low levels of contaminants in four nearby waterways spanning seven and a half miles including: Leslie Run a creek which runs through East Palestine and neighboring Negley right through the back of Kathy Reese's property. in the back of your property. Back here, they found yeah, they saw that fish. Reece says she has been drinking bottled water instead of well water ever since she started spotting dead fish in the creek. following the derailment, she says she's still waiting for the state to come and test her well water air wise. I Feel okay Water Wise no I know there's just too many chemicals and stuff that were spilled that they still don't want to identify completely. an Ohio Department of Natural Resources officials estimates some 3500 fish in the state have died following the train derailment. These people saw the Flames from their homes and wearing their neighborhood still may not be safe. What about testing water or ground? Nothing yet. no and I like I said I don't recommend you put anything in the ground I mean vegetables or tomatoes or anything this year because we don't know I Don't think they're going to do enough and some residents say they have been frustrated by what they describe as a lack of communication with officials on the ground. We pass all of the creeks and there's crew after crew with white hoses and black hoses. All Through The Creeks They're not telling us why and this is go. This is daily. I'm driving my children to school past all of this and they're asking me questions that I don't have answers to some of their questions unanswered. We found getting information just as challenging. The keys tell me, are they pumping water out or are you pumping water back in to talk to the guys up at the top of the hill? Sir? Yeah, we're just grunts. We're just trying to get a sense of what what those pumps are. Can just someone just Norfolk Southern can tell you everything. That's the hotline. They can tell you everything. You realize people are calling this number and no one is getting back to them. We're just told to direct people to that number. The Governor asked by reporters Tuesday if he would feel comfortable living in. East Palestine I I Think that I would be drinking the bottled water um, and I would be continuing to uh, find out what the tests were showing as far as the air. I would be alert and and concerned. but I think I would probably be back in my house. but residents like Kathy Reese say they are left with few choices. Just don't just pray and uh, you drink a bottle of water until we know for sure what's going on. 10 second Trivia which of these is the most visited Urban Park in the U.S Golden Gate Park in San Francisco DC's National Mall Central Park in New York or Lincoln Park in Chicago. With 40 million annual visitors, Central Park is the most visited city park in the U.S [Applause] The park is also home to a wide range of wildlife as you can imagine, but a newcomer is getting most of the attention right now. Flacco The owl escaped from the Central Park Zoo and is at large and on the loose in the park. The rare Eurasian eagle owl escaped his enclosure on February 2nd and since then Zoo officials have kept an eye on the bird, which has become a bit of a celebrity. While Flacco seems to be adapting well to the wild, there are some concerns over how he might adapt to that New York City lifestyle. There's a new star in Central Park and he's right out of Central Casting Lately, bird watchers only have eyes for owls and some fans on David Barrett's birder blog are saying let Flacco be free in the beginning of February Flacco Escaped from his exhibit at the Central Park Zoo After someone cut through the stainless steel mesh, his enclosure didn't have room to do much flying and his first night of Freedom the NYPD almost corralled him on a Fifth Avenue sidewalk. Well, that was a hoot. The NYPD tweeted when the owl flew off I was worried that it wouldn't be able to fly, but it spread its wings and flew to the nearest set of trees. Zoo Officials were most worried that Flaco didn't know how to hunt since he's always had his meals delivered. They tried to lure him using a white rat in a cage, hoping he'd get trapped in the wiry filaments on top. The zoo team was rushing with Nets to get Flaco but Flacco was too fast and now fans are snapping photos of Flacco catching his own dinner rats on the menu. Barrett says the owl is gone from zero hunting skills to decent hunting skills. That's just an incredible transformation he hangs out in Central Park Charming New Yorkers with hooting so low it requires subtitles [Music] like other creatures not native to. Central Park Flaco The Eurasian Eagle owl has become one of the select few All right. I know you are all ready to flee for the weekend like Flacco Monday is President's day, so no show that day. Originally established in 1885 in recognition of President George Washington The U.S holiday now recognizes all presidents past and present. Fairmont West Virginia You're getting the shout out today! East Fairmont Middle School Rise Up Hornets! Have a wonderful weekend everyone and remember you are more powerful than you know. It's been a blessing to spend this week with you.

EPA Administrator Michael Regan visited the region on Thursday to assess the ongoing response and hear from impacted residents. Health officials are urging some East Palestine residents to drink bottled water until tests are complete. Flacco the rare Eurasian eagle owl escaped his enclosure on February 2nd and since then Zoo officials have kept an eye on the bird, which has become a bit of a celebrity. Zoo officials were most worried that Flaco didn't know how to hunt since he's always had his meals delivered."
